DIODE TESTING ASSEMBLE: A TOOL FOR VERIFYING DIODE CHARACTERISTICS,"Diode Characteristic Tester is an electronic device which measures the different parameters of the Diodes. It figures out the ability of the diode to withstand beyond its limitations set by the manufacturing semiconductor industry. It must observe that the busted diode will not always be seen in physical conditions; instead, its internal performances will matter. Through the use of this newly designed tester, the internal behavior of the diode can be defined and exemplified. Although there are some existing diode testers which are available, the system used will be accounted as the primary difference. Existing diode testers have a very big difference in terms of cost and size. It is almost three times larger compared to this newly designed tester. Another downside is the complexity of the design which requires the expertise before it can be well operated. In this design, the testing mechanism relies on the three major components. These are the Microcontroller, Current Sensor, and the DC-DC Converter. The microcontroller is the Arduino Atmega328 version 3 which serves as the main tester that will read the parameters of the specific diode characteristics through its analog pins. The Current Sensor will amplify the small leakage current from the diode under the Reverse Bias condition. The amplification part is needed since the microcontroller cannot read a very small voltage. The last part is the DC-DC converter which converts the 300 Volts supply into 5 Volts since the microcontroller can read up to this range only. As the supply voltage approaches to zero, the read voltage from the converter that will be fed to the microcontroller will also approach to zero. Then, all the data was displayed through an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). Based on the result, the value measured using the newly designed tester was almost similar to the value measured using the Digital tester with a percentage of 95%, 99%, and 95.4% for the Forward Voltage Test, Reverse Voltage Test, and Reverse Current Test respectively. This was done using the T- Test method to show the similarity between the two testers in terms of reading the value.

OCR BASED AUTOMATED EVALUATION OF TEST QUESTIONNAIRES,"Educators have long been using written examination in assessing students performances. Even if there are already available online platforms made to automate test and evaluation, there are still valid reasons for not adopting them. With the advent of new technology like image processing, automation can be done to minimize the time consumed in checking a vast number of test questionnaires. The system was designed to recognize handwritten answers from the test questionnaires, which can be generated by the system through a desktop application. The types of test that the system can cater is limited to multiple choice and true or false only. Several optical character recognition (OCR) techniques for image enhancement like grayscale conversion and histogram equalization and Tesseract for character recognition was applied to match the student's answers from the teacher's answer key to obtain the desired results. After evaluating all the answered test questionnaires, item analysis report can also be generated. A total of twenty test questionnaires with five questions in each type were created to identify if the method applied was efficient in the real-life scenario.

One of the heavily affected localities is Butuan City, which is located in the downstream portion of Agusan River near Butuan Bay where the river drains. Although it was reported that flooding was due to the overflowing of the river, it is not yet clear if the level of inundation was affected, or even aggravated by tidal conditions in Butuan Bay. In this study, the researchers conducted an analysis of the effects of tidal conditions on the 2014 Agaton flooding event in Butuan City using a combination of geospatial and numerical modeling approaches. First, they developed and calibrated a hydrologic model using HEC HMS 3.5 to estimate the volume of flood water that enters Butuan City coming from the upstream portion of Agusan River Basin and from other nearby watersheds. Then, they developed a two-dimensional hydraulic model based on HEC RAS 5 to simulate the movement and propagation of flood waters from the upstream, including the rise and fall of water level in Butuan Bay due to tidal effects. The hydraulic model is fed with discharge hydrographs computed by the calibrated hydrologic model, and time series data of tides in Butuan Bay. A separate 2D simulation was implemented wherein flood waters coming from the upstream are allowed to flow freely towards Butuan Bay without tidal effects. For these two simulations, flood depth and hazard maps were generated and analyzed to determine tidal effects on the depth and extent of flooding, including the level impacts to structures with and without consideration of tidal effects. Results show that flood depths and extents simulated by the hydraulic model considering tidal effects have little difference to the simulated results without tidal effects. Our simulations seem to suggest that flooding in Butuan City during Agaton event was not aggravated by tidal condition, and that flooding appears to be mainly due to the long duration and high volume of rainfall brought by TS Agaton, However, the results and conclusions of this study must be taken with caution due to several limitations that may be addressed by future studies.

A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM ON FACULTY MANAGEMENT AND UTILIZATION IN CEIT,"One concern in an educational institution such as the College of Engineering and Information Technology is its faculty distribution, basically per division basis. In this study, a Decision Support System served as a deviation from the accustomed automated input/output processes of academic resources in the educational framework of the college. With this model, the system could be able to generate results from projected and real-time data and compare their deviations to draw significant outcome. Results from the system showed that any difference in the values of projected and actual faculty population in CEIT would generate remarks which would help the decision-maker on his/her analysis. If the projected result is lesser than the actual number of faculty members, the system would prompt an ""excess"" remark, concluding that the college hired faculty members in a particular semester greater than they supposedly need; otherwise ""shortage"" would be reflected. Seldom results of full capacity would result ""ok"" in the system. Faculty members were categorized based on their field of specialization, i.e. the degree they had graduated from. This is the most prevalent case in the faculty admission relationship in CEIT considering IT and other computer and technological courses in CEIT has been increasingly in demand over a period of time."
FACTORS INFLUENCING TRAVELERS' AND MOTORIST' ACCEPTANCE OF INTILLEGENT TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS: A SEM-ANN APPROACH,"One of the main barriers to the growth and transformation of developing countries is traffic congestion. Numerous nations have put in place national smart city programs to enhance business operations, quality of life, and competitiveness. The Sydney Coordinated Adoptive Traffic System, Ride-hailing Services, Motorbike Taxi Services, Traffic Navigators, Waze, and Apple Maps are just a few of the smart transportation applications being implemented, particularly in metro Manila. These advancements and innovations are being implemented and used. However, there has been a dearth of research that examined user behaviors in relation to smart transportation service. This sparked a need for an exploratory research on user behavior when using intelligent transportation systems. In order to assess the adoption of a new technology, the study applies the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the conceptual framework, which has been widely used in previous research. This research also employed a dual-mode survey design, administering online and in-person surveys to a sample of 500 respondents, in order to test the hypotheses of the theoretical model with the use of partial least squares component based structural equation modeling. By utilizing partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), this study sought to determine the factors that impact users' trust and intention to use intelligent transportation applications. The findings showed that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), and trust all had a positive effect on user intention (UI). Among four factors that affect trust, PEU is more potent to influence the respondents of the study to trust artificial intelligent transportation applications. The results of PLS-SEM are further verified through the ANN approach and the results of PLS-SEM and ANN complement each other and produced more thorough results. The researchers believe that this study has provided crucial information to other researchers who are interested in aspects that influence motorists' and travelers' acceptance of intelligent transportation systems.

This project was conducted in the month of July 2004 and ended in the month of December 2004 Series of interviews were conducted to obtain the complete data of the existing process It was found out that the Supply Office of Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology is responsible for the distribution of equipment which is a request by the requisitioner and inventorying equipment (check if it is appropriate). In distribution of equipment Memorandum Receipt is used. Mr. Joaquin R. Conde Jr. and the Institute Auditor do the physical count twice a year by using the Equipment Inventory Report. They also separate the waste equipment through the use of Waste Materials Report. The current system is purely manual process. They use different forms in processing data. A thorough study of the current system of Inventorying Equipment and determining its drawback, the current system of the Supply Office will be superceded with a web-based system application in inventorying equipment. They used a software application in making Inventory Report, Waste Material Report and Memorandum Receipt. With this proposed system, the Supply Officer will automatically input the data to the software application instead of manual process. It can minimize time and avoid errors in inputting the data. Then the data is safer because it stored in a database."
BARANGAY ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FOR BARANGAY DUMALAGAN,"Today's competitive environment is forcing Barangay to optimize the transaction processes and accounting levels while at the same time ensure accuncy of controls and implementation of standard procedures for the flow of accountant's rules However, in the absence of appropriate systems and information infrastructure, Barangay are finding it difficult to achieve definite and efficient improvement Manual accounting systems utilize several paper lodgers to record financial transactions. Barangay's have separate ledgers for each part of the accounting system, such as accounts payable, accounts receivable and reports. Accountants then consolidate these ledgers into one general ledger, providing the balance for each ledger. The general ledger notebook assists in creating financial statement. Thus, the researchers proposed Barangay accounting system that will give safer storage of financial records, fast retrieval of files, maintains reliability and accuracy, and faster tracking of files. Proposing software for the accounting system is very useful to the staff, from hand written records and manual issuing of barangay clearance and certificates, as well as the income and expenses reports into an automated processing system"

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF WATERSENSE: AN IOT APPLICATION WITH VISUAL ANALYTICS FOR WATER CONSUMPTION MONITORING,"Water is imperative in the regular day to day existence of the human race. Household people use water to sustain life. Nowadays, household people are uninformed of their real-time water consumption. These leads to excessive water usage. With the use of the internet of things (IoT) platform with visual analytics (VA), this study designed and developed WaterSense, a real-time water consumption monitoring for household and commercialized building applications. The study used a ""Hall Effect"" water flow sensor to measure the water flow, which is then processed by a NodeMCU microcontroller. The water flow data is sent to a Heroku cloud database and at the same time shown to the LCD alphanumeric screen attached to every faucet in the building. In visualizing the processed data, this study uses charts for comprehensible reports as visualization. In getting the accurate water flow rate, the calibration factor is set. An accuracy test was conducted in ten trials using ten bottles of 10 liters in one faucet, ten bottles of 10 liters in two and three faucets at a time. The study comes up with a total average accuracy of 99.38%. It is then concluded that WaterSense can make an accurate water consumption monitoring in real- time with multiple faucets simultaneously and the system can identify which faucet has the highest use in a particular time. The developed system can nudge the consumer to be aware of their water consumption.
