DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A FIRE DETECTION AND ALARM SYSTEM PROTOTYPE BASED ON A WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK,"A fire detection and alarm system prototype based on wireless sensor network is an advanced technology monitoring system that detects fire. A UHF Data Transceiver will transmit data or a message from the sensors to the server. Temperature sensor LM35 and smoke sensor HIS-07 were used in detecting fires; it would sound an alarm if there was a fire detected by the sensors. Using Gizduino Mini Plus Microcontroller, the message was interpreted using the UHF Data Transceiver and transmitted to the server or the base station to pass the information from the node. The server or the monitoring station was placed near the security guards. The researchers also used a GSM/GPRS Shield. The purpose of the GSM/GPRS Shield was to inform the university personnel who were in charge of that building. They would receive a text message by using the GSM. The Raspberry Pi B+ was about the size of a credit card and had a 32-bit ARM processor. It was used to collect data from the three nodes which the Gizduino Mini Plus Microcontroller interpreted. The raspberry pi displayed the output by using the LCD Monitor, and it also indicated in the LCD Monitor which node detected the fire.

"A KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM N MATCHING TREE, PLANT AND LEGUMES ON MINERAL-BEARING SITE","A Knowledge-Based System on Matching of Tree, Plant and Legumes on Mineral-Bearing Site is a web-based expert system designed to find suitable species for the reclamation of the mining wastelands. This system is capable of recommending species that would help in the restoration/rehabilitation of the particular site based on its biophysical characteristics; altitude, temperature, rainfall, soil texture/type/characteristics and soil pH. The selected species used in this study is based on A Research Compendium for Mining and Volcanic Debris-Laden Areas, a research study of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) that has been developed to serve as a sound and thorough basis for selection of appropriate, effective and efficient strategies for the restoration of damaged mining and volcanic ash-laden areas of the country. Though it handles very complex data, the application is simple enough so that end users can run the program and perform sensitivity analysis with minimum training time. This system displays customized screens, allows interface calls to external programs, and has an explanation facility to assist the system user. In terms of usability and impact assessment, this system is acceptable as perceived by the respondents during software testing and evaluation and they find it useful and easy to use. It gained a grand mean of 4.53 that indicates an excellent verbal interpretation.

WEB-BASED STUDENT SUBJECT EVALUATION SYSTEM FOR NORMISIST,"A project was designed to create a computer-based student subject evaluation system for the Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology. This new system addresses the long-time problem of hazzle and delay in the enrollment and evaluation of subjects of students. Because of its automated system, the voluminous works in student's record were made easy and fast which resulted to savings in labor and time and consequently a high work efficiency. This new system is capable of displaying the different forms of subject evaluation report of the students such as subjects in a course curriculum, subjects that have prerequisite, subjects that were already taken and passed, subjects that have a grade of 5.00 or failing grade, INC or Incomplete Grade, DROP or subjects that have been dropped, subjects that were allowed to the student to be taken in the next semester, subjects that were previously enrolled by a student, and all the electives subjects in a curriculum that they are suppose to enroll. To automate the student's subject evaluation system, the following were used: Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004 for building the system web site, PHP Version 4 for general scripting language that is especially suited for web development, MySQL Version 5.0.0 alpha for storing multiple records, and Apache HTTP Server for finally connecting to the server. Results of the project show that automated student's subject evaluation system accelerates the processes of encoding, storing and retrieving student's records. Thus makes the system fast and efficient.",webbased student subject evaluation system normisista project designed create computerbased student subject evaluation system northern mindanao state

A SYSTEM DESIGN FOR UNIFIED TVET PROGRAM REGISTRATION MANAGEMENT,"A System Design for Unified TVET Programs Registration Management System (UTPRMS) is developed to gmerate, create and to update the data of the clients, store information and categorize data that the management can access with ease, manage the system functionalities, and can generate information. It is a system design used to manage client's records from past to presents. It is meant to provide the Administration and Staff, with information in real-time to make their work more interesting and less stressing which serves as a key factor for the flow of business transactions in TESDA Provincial Office Butuan City. This research project is aimed at computerizing the records about clients. In order to achieve this goal, a thorough System Soudy and investigation was carried out and data was collected and analysed about the current system using document and data flow diagrams. The concept of report production has been computerized hence, no more delay in report generation to the TESDA administrator. The method used to develop the system include Unified Modelling Language(UML), dataflow, context, Use Case and entity relationship diagram were used to design the system and finally the language used were MySql and Visual Basic 6.0.

ABACADA DIAGNOSTIC AGENT IN PEST MANAGEMENT,"Abaca, the country's premier fiber and known worldwide as Manila hemp, has come a long way from its humble beginning as raw material for our ancestors' coarse and stiff clothing as well as footwear. Hence, abaca fiber continues to give big earnings in the Philippines that make the country known worldwide, abaca plant itself experienced lots of attacks with the presence of diseases and insect pests. These things contribute to give lesser yield in the abaca industry. With the help of technicians and abaca experts, prevalence of diseases and insect pests can be minimized. On the other hand, abaca experts are not always available to be referred. Through the system which can identify abaca diseases, insect pests and weeds and the same time gives recommendation for proper management it can help raise the production of abaca. This research presents an integration approach involving Artificial Intelligence, Predicate Logic, Production Rules and agricultural analysis to identify abaca diseases, insect pests and weeds. With the use of Exsys Corvid, data of each case, with its corresponding selected bio-physical characteristics were converted into then rules and inputted in a logic block. The command block contains procedural commands that tell the inference engine how to use the inputted data. The results of this research are very valuable to abaca growers, agriculture and forestry sectors, students and researchers. Agricultural technologists, farmers, students or any individual may use the practicable information and diagnosing feature of this expert system in order to gain knowledge and apply management to create better abaca production. Using the weighted mean formula to test the system's efficacy. sufficiency and software environment to its prospect users, results show that a grand mean of 2.50 which has a ""Good"" verbal description and falls within the range of 1.51- 2.50, can be translated as good perception of respondents for the system.

PLANNING AND DESIGNING AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM IN CARAGA REGION,"Agroforestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around of among crops or pastureland. It combines shrubs and tree in agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy, and sustainable land use-system. The Land Capability Assessment and Mapping of an area is one of the requirements to achieve best possible utilization of a farming land resource for sustainable agricultural production. The productivity of the crops and trees corresponds to the bio- physicals of the land and its sustainability and the technical skills and capabilities of the farmer's. However, the manual and normal process in assessing land capability and locating its area suitability takes more time to do and is not easy for the land-use officials, farmers and individuals. This study aims to develop an Automated Agroforestry System in Caraga Region that will assist agricultural sectors in agricultural productions. The Land Capability Assessment will ease the dissemination of information on the lands bio-physical data and recommends crops that is suited to be planted in a specific area in Caraga Region. The application of Information Technology helps in automating the system. With the use of Xampp and PHP, data of the selected crop and forest tree species, with its corresponding selected bio-physical characteristics such as altitude (elevation), soil type, temperature, and rainfall requirements are manipulated for assessing land capability. And with the use of Google Fusion, identifying crop suitability in a specific area can be easily located. Furthermore, software reliability check has been conducted to know the accuracy of the system Keywords: Xampp, PHP, Google Fusion",planning designing agroforestry system caraga regionagroforestry land

A WEB-BASED FORECASTING TOOL FOR MEASURING THE PH AND FECAL COLIFORM LEVEL OF CHOSEN BEACHES IN AGUSAN DEL NORTE,"Agusan del Norte is a province where you can find beautiful place for recreation like beaches. Clean beach is one of the factors that the tourists must consider first before going but there are also some beaches which have found to have a higher level of pH and fecal coliform. The higher the level of fecal coliform gives disadvantages to human health like typhoid fever, viral and bacterial gastroenteritis and hepatitis A. Also with pil the higher the level the sooner the beaches will not be suitable for any human recreational activities and marine life will not survive as well. With this, a Web-Based Forecasting Tool for Measuring ph and fecal coliform level was developed in order to show to the public the forecasted amount of these two elements found in the beaches in Agusan del Norte. The researchers used the Exponential Method to measure the level of pH and fecal coliform for the next month and Time Series Method for measuring the levels five years from the given data.

RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION SYSTEM USING CLASSIFICATION DATA MINING TECHNIQUE,"Among the challenges that a growing agency or organization faces in human resource management is evaluating and screening the pool of applicants and selecting the most suitable and deserving candidates to fill the vacant positions. This study explored historical data and classification data mining techniques to address the problem. Information technology was exploited to meet its objectives and implement its strategies. The Recruitment and Selection System using data mining technique is a system that collects data from applicants through an internet-based interface, automatically computes scores on every hiring criterion and then classifies the applicants using an artificial neural network model. The model correctly classified instances with an accuracy rate of 88.61%, and the system was able to output the long list, shortlist and finally, the list of applicants for selection in the prescribed report template for the head of the agency as a support for decision-making. This study aids in the enhancement of the existing human resource processes and provides essential support and assistance to the selection committee and head of the agency in making well-grounded, fair, and consistent decisions.

AN AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION OF TREE SPECIES IN CARAGA STATE UNIVERSITY,"An automated identification of tree species was developed to help identify the most common trees in Caraga State University. It was possible to identify tree by looking at their leaves. However, in most cases, it was possible to make an identification using just a few features of the leaves. The automation was based on morphological characteristics such as leaf arrangement, as of composition, shape, margin, base, apex, surface, and venation within CSU campus. The expert system used photographs to identify its morphological characteristics. After identifying a tree in an expert system, it would visualize the location of the identified tree by using GIS mapping. The use of computers in modern day research has helped to overcome the routine identification. It then becomes imperative to attempt the use of computer in identifying various species of trees. This Automated Mentification of Tree Species in Caraga State University (AITSCSU) integrates expert system and GIS mapping using EXSYS Corvid as knowledge expert system shell and GeoServer for GIS. This would guide the user in a step by step approach to accomplish the task of identifying and locating tree species in CSU. Find a tree in your natural environment, collect a leaf and answer the tree identification questions in an expert system. After the question interview was complete. you should be able to identify a tree's name by its common name. You can also visualize the location of a tree through GIS map.

AN AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM OF MANGROVE SPECIES FOUND ALONG BUTUAN BAY,"An Automated Identification System of Mangrove Species Found Along Butuan Bay is a web-based integration of Expert System and Geographic Information System which designed for the data automation, since knowledge can only be realized when it was well documented by using modern interactive database for the benefit of the present and future generations. In this research, the system was capable to identify mangrove species based on its unique physical characteristics and to visualize the location of the identified species using GIS. Although it handles very complex data, the application is simple enough so that end users can run the program and perform sensitivity analysis with minimum training time. Moreover, the data used in this research was based on the research conducted by Mr. Jess Jumawan a faculty member of Caraga State University and also an expert of mangroves. In addition, the system was developed with the following software: Exsys Corvid for the automation of the knowledge base, Quantum GIS for creation of the map and shapefile, PostgreSQL, Geoserver and Open layers for layer storage and visualization of points in the map. And lastly, Joomla serve as graphical user interface of the system. In terms of usability and impact assessment, this system was acceptable as perceived by the respondents during software testing and evaluation and they find it useful and easy to use.

WEB BASED INTERACTIVE CARAGA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS MAP,"An interactive campus map is vital for connecting the whole school community, including students, alumni, and campus offices. It provides a simple approach for alumni to navigate campus changes after being away for a while. It also makes it easier for campus departments to communicate with the students they wish to interact with. The dynamic map displays data in an easy-to-use format, making it simple to identify, find, alter, format, and share information. The use of visual navigation simplifies the process, allowing even untrained users to see correlations, trends, and outliers, assisting in decision-making. The researchers did, however, identify an issue with Caraga State University's static campus map, which is out of date and redundant. To solve this, the researchers used the Laragon local development environment to create an interactive campus map. This solution allows for the rapid creation of a local development environment for web apps. The interactive map delivers crucial geographic features without having users read through text-heavy pages by employing visual information processing. It has numerous layers that accommodate various datasets and makes use of the Campus Map Admin system for proactive updates. Users can interact with the map to acquire information that is relevant to their personal requirements.

MICROCONTENT ENCAPSULATION AS DATA ENTRY USING QR CODE,"Android operating system has successfully integrated in mobile phones. Nowadays, smartphones are widely used throughout the world. While technology advances, text can now be represented in different forms. Quick Response code is one way of hiding text in an image and it was vastly emerged in industries. Filling up the application form by hand is time consuming and cost expensive. In this paper the proponent collects different application forms and developed a way to hide all the personal information in QR codes. The built android application is able to encode QR code, decode QR code, display information in a form and gmerate user-defined portable data file application form using Zxing library and Droidtext library. Based on the series of experiments and testing, it was concluded that using QR codes to hide personal information needed in application forms and creation of user-defined application is possible.

DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INTELLIGENT QUEUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MINIMIZING LONG QUEUES,"As an institution, the Caraga State University must provide quality and standard services to its clientÃ¨les. This can be achieved by upgrading its infrastructure that is essential to improve the overall performance not just the one who acquire the service but to the service provider, respectively. One of the problems that needs improvement is the long queue that student may experience during enrolment and major examination days. A middleware must be developed to control long queues by managing different request varying on the distribution of request to appropriate server in order to massively reduced waiting period. A Single Queue with Multiple server was the queue model of the application and has its middleware named Queue Request Manager, the middleware has the responsibility in allocating different requests to the available server, and an algorithm has been constructed for the synchronization and distribution of queues. Simulations was carried out and were graphically presented to show the significant increase of performance using this application Keywords: Queue, Middleware, Client-Server, Microsoft Visual Studio

"DESIGN, FABRICATION AND EVALUATION OF MECHANICALLY OPERATED TABLEA MOLDER","As the growing demand of Tablea continuously grows, the supply is hardly met. Commonly, the Tables makers press and mold the cocoa mass into tablets through Plastic Molders and Pulvoron Type Molder causing them to have high manpower and delay of operation. Existing Pulvoron Type Molders consume longer time during production, produces one molded Tables at a time, inconsistent size and weight of the Tablea Therefore, this study was conducted to contribute and meet Tablea demand by means of introducing mechanically operated Tables molder. Performance Evaluation of the machine in terms of molding capacity and efficiency were considered using three pulley diameters at different speeds as treatments. The machine operating at 18"" pulley (97 rpm) showed the highest molding capacity and efficiency at 841.11 pcs/hr and 88.17%, respectively. Economic analysis showed that the machine gave rate of return of 69.09% and a payback period of 15.63 months.

ACCREDITION DOCUMENTS AGGREGATOR USING MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFIER,"Automatic Document Classification (ADC) is an application to supervise machine learning. The goal is to predict class(es) to unseen and unlabeled documents by using the knowledge acquired from training sample of related pre-labeled documents. Most real-world applications of ADC are attributed to multi-label problems, the event where one document is categorized into multiple classes. The proposed study explored supervised document classification techniques for the multi-label problem of classifying accreditation documents based on AACCUP instrument's criteria and parameters. The accuracy score that the model achieved to the test set was 87%. The model served as the core component in developing an Expert System for aggregating accreditation-related documents. With the developed system, the accuracy score was validated with the human annotation comparing the result to the system's prediction and achieved an 88% accuracy score. The system was evaluated with a USE questionnaire. While automating its classification, the proposed system will also provide a centralized repository of these documents, enabling the accreditation committee and institute administrators to monitor and manage these documents easily, thus helping the institution at large in alleviating the workload of accreditation activity.

BUSINESS-DRIVEN MODEL TO HELP MITIGATE ELECTRONIC WASTE IN BUTUAN CITY,"Based on the United Nation's Global E-waste Monitor 2017, the quantity of e-waste generation in 2016 was around 44.7 million metric tones (Mt), or 6.1 kg per inhabitant. It is estimated that in 2017, the world e-waste generation will exceed 46 Mt and expected to grow to 52.2 Mt in 2021, with an annual growth rate of 3 to 4%. With the 44.7 Mt e-waste generated in 2016, only 20% (8.9 Mt) is documented to be collected and properly recycled, while 80% (35.8 Mt) is not documented (4% thrown into residual waste, 76% unknown). In 2013 to 2015, the Philippines have annually generated a total of around 4,7000 tons of e-waste, 14.91% of which came from the National Capital Region alone (EMB- DENR, 2016). The most common e-waste in the country are cellular phones, computers, laptops, and appliances such as televisions and refrigerators. To mitigate this prevalent growth of electronic wastes, assessment of this kind of wastes and investigation on how the community manages it were conducted and a business-driven model was developed. The model consisted of integrated waste management models modified to incorporate a business-driven approach where people may see it not as a government mandate but as motivation to help mitigate waste while raising revenue streams.

AUTOMATED BUILDING FOOTPRINT EXTRACTION FROM DSM AND ATM IN ARCGIS,"Building information produced from earth observation data is now being widely used in the development and simulation of different studies. The manual method of obtaining the building footprints is laborious and time-consuming hence this study aims to create a method that will cater an automatic extraction of building footprints. This study focused on the exclusive use of LiDAR-derived Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) in order to obtain the Normalized Digital Surface Model (NDSM) and be able to extract building footprints of the area. Using NDSM and the knowledge on building geometric characteristics, such as height, slope and area the researcher would be able to separate the buildings from the other features existing on the surface. Existing tools of ArcGIS are collected and integrated in the ModelBuilder order to create an interface that will be used as an end-to-end tool in extracting the building footprints. In ModelBuilder, the model is represented as a diagram that chain together sequences of processes and geoprocessing tools, using the output of one process as the input to another by the user. process. The result of this study should provide an interface where parameters may define Keywords: NDSM, DTM, DSM, ModelBuilder, Building Footprint",automated building footprint extraction dsm atm

KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION ON INSTRUMENT-BASED DOCUMENT COLLECTION,"Caraga State University (CSU), as an institution of higher learning, endeavors to achieve its Mission, Vision, Goals, and Objectives to be responsive to regional and national goals, and continually maintain quality standards through accreditation. Accreditation is one way to keep Higher Educational Institutions in check against standards in place. CSU continues its venture on sending its different programs for accreditation. Consequently, as the university prepares for the accreditation survey visits, several documents have to be prepared, compiled, and organized in accordance to the AACCUP OBQA Survey Instrument. With the growing and progressive community of CSU, faculty members are engaged in various academic and research endeavors, and accreditation-related activities become an add-on assignment for them, adding to their full load of tasks. Document collection during accreditation preparation is the most essential job an accreditation taskforce needs to comply. This includes reviewing of the survey instrument and meticulously identify (the most critical part) and collect the appropriate documents to be attached as support documents in specific benchmark statements/parameters. This task must be done correctly, otherwise, resources, time, and effort will be wasted. Apparently, the process is tedious. Hence, to simplify the task of document identification, this study acquired and extracted knowledge from accreditation experts as baseline data for the automation of document collection for accreditation. Knowledge Acquisition on Instrument-based document collection aimed to acquire knowledge on accreditation document collection and provide a methodology to analyze and to identify significant rules or keywords that make-up a certain document that accordingly supports a specific benchmark statement in the survey instrument. Making the document collection manageable and efficient.

AGUSAN NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL WEB-BASED STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM WITH SMS NOTIFICATION,"Changes in Information Technology (IT) allow schools to utilize databases and applications such as Online Student Information System. Thus, making the accessing of records centralized. One of the changes that came about is the online-based applications. These applications improved the traditional-transaction processing systems. Agusan National High School (ANHS) is still using a semi-computer based system and paper-based student information system. Staffs find it tedious in searching and managing student records and also laborious due to repetition of processes done in filling and updating of records. The institution also consists of large population of students making its services less convenient for both faculty and students. The researcher developed a Web-Based Student Information System with SMS Notification capable of handling student records and school services especially during enrolment. The paper focuses on presenting information in an easy and intelligible manner which provides facilities like online enrolment and profile creation of students and teachers, ranking and promotions, clearance, and SMS notification service.

RULES INTEGRATION ON OBJECT-ORIENTED CLASS SCHEDULING SYSTEM (ORCSS),"Class scheduling system has its aim to arrange periods, subjects, rooms and faculties to all courses in academic year. The limited number of human, and material resource available such as, instructors, rooms, time schedules, and the restrictions of their use means that the timetable have to be constrained so that certain conditions are met. This paper describes a rules structure that handles the said constraints satisfaction problems. Rule engine will handle all of these constraints satisfaction problems, and has the capability to implement rules using constraints to attain efficient and accurate class schedule results to the Object-Oriented Class Scheduling System.",rule integration objectoriented class scheduling system orcssclass scheduling system aim arrange period subject room faculty course academic year limited

COAL DUST MITIGATION: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BIODEGRADABLE REAGENTS USED IN IUNDERGROUND COAL MINE,"Coal dust is a universal problem to coal mining industry, alleviation of dust brings health risks to coal miners, lump dust due to moisture absorption causes formation of caking. This study is about the experimental of coal dust mitigation used in underground coal mine to alleviate coal dust dispersion and lower the health hazard risk of the workers. This study focuses on the reagents to which is the most effective: oleic acid, sodium oleate and stearic acid. In this study, moisture content and its dispersibility is experimented and studied. The sub-bituminous coal samples were first crushed and pulverized using the primary, secondary, and tertiary crusher. Each 10 grams of Sub- bituminous coal samples was applied with reagents and then settled for 3 hours before the actual weighing. Moisture content was determined using the initial and final weight. To get the dispersion, an experimental apparatus was made. Results show that the most effective reagent is sodium oleate, which exhibits good moisture percentage and high dispersibility test.

GEOCARE: A MOBILE-BASED COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE FOR CITIZENS REPORTING,"Collective intelligence is crucial to motivating community engagement and improving the local government units. Through collective intelligence, residents can directly provide reliable reports and issue concerns within the City. This study employed the development and implementation of a mobile application, which facilitated the exchange of real-time information and observations related to various problems such as vehicle accidents, calamity/flood, waste management, traffic issues, fire emergency, and people-related issues. The test conducted in this study involved alpha testing and beta testing to focus on refining the software by identifying and fixing bugs, while beta testing involved deploying the system to users for feedback and making further improvements. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the application in providing valuable information about the performance of using collective intelligence. Integrating GPS, geolocation, and geotagging applications enhanced the functionality, allowing for efficient and targeted responses to different situations and events. This study can contribute by encouraging citizen participation in environmental monitoring and reporting.

DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF TOUCH SCREEN-BASED AUTOMATED HOME SWITCHING USING INFRARED SENSOR SYNC TO ANDROID PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH,"Combining switch and picture frame having a slide show of photos that adds attraction to houses, how about controlling devices easily by just a soft touch and control it remotely via Bluetooth using Android phone. In this technical project these are made possible. By using (OLED) Shield is a 2"" diagonal, 128x160 pixels Graphic Display serves as the GUI (Graphic User Interface) that allow to display image. Also using IR (Infrared) LED's and Photo diodes to create a touch screen base interface. In order to access Bluetooth, the researcher used EGBT-045MS Bluetooth module to communicate Android phone and also made a specific application for Android through M IT App Inventor 2, a free online Android application package (APK) maker. The communication between the touch screen based switch is wireless by using UHF II (Multi-Channel UHF Data Transceiver) and used a relay to drive the devices.",design implementation evaluation touch

GAME-BASED LEARNING AND ASSESSMENT,"Computer games are one of the most rapidly grooving areas since computers start to take place in our life. Game-based learning has been defined as ""the use of computer game- based approach to deliver, support, and enhance teaching, learning, assessment, and evaluation. This is a research area that may be abstracted as the node of learning concept, computer games model and design, user interfaces, and subject matter expertise. Integrated learning is a pedagogical design that integrates a rich set of instruction, learning and technological components. With a view to the said subject matter, this study proposes to create another effective tool for an effective learning and efficient educational outcomes through the game-based learning application. This study focused on developing a game application through the use of Eqela Software Tools and Adobe Tools. This game based learning and assessment application was developed with a learning material to help the preschools' and 1"" graders', basically, five (5) to seven (7) years old to enhance their mathematical comprehension abilities. This is a game and a learning tool/application especially made to nurture minds of the young generation.

SERVER CONFIGURATION FOR MULTIPLE THIN CLIENTS ACCESS,"Computer laboratories play a vital role in an institution. It is where the students are trained in terms of Information Technology. Unfortunately the laboratories of NORMISIST have only few computers and most of them are running slowly due to its old hardware and software installed in it. But these old computer units can be utilized and maximize its capabilities if they will be converted to thin clients. In the study, even without a hard disk, a computer can still run if it will be connected into a server. The applications can be accessed via the network from the server through the network boot loaders such as the Pre-execution Environment, floppy and Compact Disk. The thin dient networking system can provide a big help not only to the NORMISIST as a whole and also to the laboratory administrator. The laboratory management becomes easy and controllable because the data are saved in a single storage located in the server and become accessible by the administrator. In the study, it is enough to install a single software package in the server that would be accessible for all thin clients. Thin client architecture also reduces maintenance, cost and time.",server configuration multiple thin client accesscomputer laboratory play vital role institution student trained term information

SMS-BASED MULTIPLE ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARDS,"Conventional electronic bulletin boards uses keypads or being reprogrammed to update its messages, thus, limits the distance in updating its messages and limiting its users to knowledgeable persons only. One example is the ""Low Cost Electronic Bulletin Board"", project of the previous BSECE students. This paper applies the SMS technology in mobile phones in updating messages to be displayed in the electronic bulletin boards. To update messages in the display boards through SMS, the system uses the SIM900D GSM modem to communicate with the authorized user's mobile phone, allowing updating messages in long distances and enables a user friendly interface. Also, it utilizes the RF technology in transmission and reception of data between two electronic bulletin boards. After receiving the SMS, the ATmega2560 microcontroller, the system controller, drives the display board and sends data to the second display board through an RF transmitter. The display board is composed of a 4x10 LED matrix array. The functionality of this project was verified through integration of the hardware and software. The design of this project has been proven to be user friendly and more flexible than the existing electronic bulletin board found in the CEIT.",smsbased multiple electronic bulletin

A RULE-BASED SYSTEM ON SITE-SPECIES MATCHING USING SELECTED BIO-PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS,"Crop adaptations vary in different biophysical requirements in which they are commonly grown. Each crop must have sufficient inputs, either practical-based or nature- based in order to produce high yield. However, farmers in the Philippines ignore land capability in selecting appropriate crops to cultivate; that is why they get low yield. In order to help farmers in selecting appropriate crops, experts are there to advise what are the suitable crops to have a productive land-management system. However, the manual and normal process in analyzing data about land capability is not easy for the experts. This study aims to develop an Expert System that would help experts in advising suitable crops to the farmers. The application of Information Technology had been a great help in automating the knowledge of the experts. With the use of EXSYS Corvid Servlet Runtime, data of the selected crop and forest tree species, with its corresponding selected bio-physical characteristics such as altitude (elevation), soil pH, soil type, temperature, and rainfall requirements are coded into logic rules and inputted in a logic block that tells the system what to do. The command block contains procedural commands that tell the inference Engine how to use the Inputted data from the logic block. The project is acceptable in terms of efficacy, sufficiency, and software environment as perceived by the respondents for having a grand mean of 2.38 which indicates a good verbal description. The output of the developed system entitled, A Rule- based System on Site-species Matching Using Selected Bio-physical Characteristics, was generally agreed by the agriculturists in Caraga State University and students who are knowledgeable about the content of the study. Furthermore, survey has been tested to know the perception of the respondents with regards to the system using the system weighted mean formula.",rulebased system sitespecies matching using selected

DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF WEB-BASED PAYROLL SYSTEM FOR NORMISIST,"Current payroll system in NORMISIST was based on traditional methods, where it operates its every processes separately. Manipulations of data from different processes will slow down the speed of operation and have a bigger chance of marginal error. In this case, the system must be developed and upgraded to enhance the performance of the system. The structural design of this study focused on the Dreamweaver MX that provides a powerful combination of visual layout tools, application development features, and code editing support, enabling developers and designers at every skill level to create visually appealing, standards-based sites and applications quickly. MYSQL Database Management was also included to handle databases and multiple records from the system. PHP was used in this design as a front- end for it supports a wide range of databases and especially suited for web development that can be embedded in the HTML. To create a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server The Apache Project was used. The study details the design of a web based payroll system that provides automatic calculation of all processes. This system can work as software applications where data can be shared and combined.",design implementation webbased payroll system normisistcurrent payroll system normisist based traditional method

DATABASE APPLICATION FOR ASGM WITH MAP RENDERING,"Database Application for ASGM with Map R Rendering is an offline system that profiles artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Caraga Region. The profiling of Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) in Caraga can provide detailed information of mining activities and mining processors within ASGM category, it is the basis for identifying the different method used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Caraga and classifies each province's artisanal and small scale gold mining owners/operators. As the main goal of this study, the proponents create a dynamic database and offline graphical mapping of the location of miners and processors located in Caraga Region. The proponents used GMap NET library for the creation of the map, which has the capacity to provide an offline mapping capability. The system was made and programmed using Visual Basic NET framework and the database in this system was made through MS Access The study can give adaptable information to the researchers of ""S&T

DIGITAL DATA CLASSIFICATION AND EXTRACTION FOR RECORDS MANAGEMENT OF PAPS AND CHILD DOCUMENTS,"Department of Social Welfare and Development-Adoption Resource and Refer Unit are in the desire of an automated system that would store data of Adoption and Foster Care cases. They would like to have a database system that would store digitize data, visual presentation of the case and notification. A database system was made that will be easily deployed and ready to use. Server-Based digital storage was made that will store the uploaded digitized documents for safekeeping and easy retrieval for future use. A case visualization was also made to visualize the clear status of timelines of the case and to view what is lacking based on tomaround time. In order to comply with the turnaround time of the case, a notification system will be embedded to the system to notify the case manager on the lacking of the case so that they can comply based on case turnaround time. The system will be configured easily so that the system will be used to its full potential. For automation purposes, the system was designed to extract data from a pdf document using Tesseract Optical Character Recognition so that the user will upload the document and the needed data will be displayed on the interface then the user will save the data to the database. The system will be deployed with the use of server-based web application for easy accessibility and secure storage of the digitized documents. Based on the sup testing of the system, the resolution with 150 dots per inch has an accuracy rate of 99.23619895. The accuracy rate of 150 DPI resolution is higher than of 300 DPI and even on a clean document generated from woed applications Keywords: Data Classification, Data Extraction, Case Visualization,

DEPLOYMENT OF BARANAGY PROFILING SYSTEM,"Deployment of Barangay Profiler System in Butuan City would provide and contribute to the improvement of the processes and quality of government services offered by a certain barangay. In deploying the system there are many aspects that needs to be validated and assessed, like (1) who are the potential barangays, (2) what are the deliverables and importance of the system, (3) what would be the impact, (4) how to revive the system for deployment. The researchers conducted a community needs assessment (CNA) to determine potential barangays as recipients. Assessment showed that barangay Bonbon and Fort Poyohon were the beneficiaries who qualified to the criteria in terms of infrastructure, technical skills and the willingness to adopt. Also impact assessment showed that the deployed system has significant support offered to the barangays in terms of issuance of certificates, profiling and the convenience that the system brings. The said system was deployed on Arpil 3, 2018 at Fort Poyohon, Butuan City and on April 4, 2018 at barangay office of Bonbon, Butuan City.

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING-BASED UNMANNED GROUND VEHICLE SIMULATION FOR CACAO POD COLLECTION,"Despite cacao being one of the world's most significant perennial crops, the harvesting process of the crop is still commonly done by hand and involves a lengthy process of collecting and picking up detached cacao pods. However, this particular manual movements of the process can be executed autonomously by Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) using Reinforcement Learning (RL) based algorithms. This study aims to simulate an RL-based UGV with a pick-up mechanism that automates the process of cacao pod collection. In this paper, the researchers used an RL algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and will be simulated via Webots, an open-source 3D robot simulator. The agent or the RL-based UGV is tested in two environments with and without obstacles, together with a randomly placed batch of cacao pods and a collection area. The results in both environments suggest the possibility of using RL-based UGV's over manual processes despite being different. The researchers determined that the agent had better performance in the environment without obstacles and thus implied the need for future improvements of the model particularly in obstacle avoidance.

RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF ARQ IN P2P CONNECTION,"Despite of the technological advances, failure still occur in the data transmission, where in response to this problem error control protocol like FBC, ARQ and Fault tolerant are being implemented in the data transmission. This study presents the reliability analysis of ARQ's: the Stop and Walt, Go Back N and Selective Repest in a P2P repairable connection. The reliability of the ARQ's determined through the derivation of its Time Dependent Reliability, MTTF and Steady State Availability for real time application purposes, and derived this by using RBD, Hierarchical Decomposition and Computational Method. The researchers then investigate the effect of the increased of the buffer size and repeat request on ARQ's reliability. Numerical results and graphs through simulation reveal the behavior of the ARQ's reliability and how its buffer size and increased of the repeat request occurrences affects its

FACULTY WORKLOAD AUTOMATION,"Determining the appropriate number of instructors to be hired is a tedious work of computation and manipulation of data. It is difficult task to analyze a set of resources to come up with an optimal and precise decision. In some situations the balancing of budgets and resources needed as the basis in getting exact faculty strength of an institution is to be considered. In this premise, the researchers developed a study that could solve and give an exact solution to this problem. The ""Faculty Workload Automation"", which is specifically concerned on determining the faculty strength and workload in an institution, will be of great help to lighten the task of administrative personnel since the system is faster than manual calculations which consume a lot of time and effort. The researchers gathered information from the Human Resource Management Office and other offices in the institute in order to the study to know the different possibilities on how and when to determine the faculty workload as well as the total numbers of instructors to be hired. This information were then used as conditions that are embedded in the system to produce an efficient output in relation to the study.",faculty workload automationdetermining appropriate number

NORMISIST PROFILE: A MULTIMEDIA PRESENTATION USING SYNTHETIC SOFTWARE,"Developing and implementing multimedia presentation is the unique medium in making reliable advertisement to any fields of emerging and informative institution. Unfortunately, NORMISIST hasn't yet developed and implemented a multimedia presentation that would cover the entire area of NORMISIST including the history, infrastructures, linkages, achievements and curricular offerings. In response to this need, this work presents the functions of synthetic software as a tool for making multimedia presentation of NORMISIST consisting of the following: Adobe Photoshop, SwissMax, ProgoldShow, CoolEdit and Macromedia FlashMX. In this work, importing and exporting of data are the basic events in making multimedia presentation. In importing data, the still images, the sounds, the animation and text must be modified first before exporting to Macromedia Flash MX. In image modification, Adobe Photoshop is used to modify graphics and pictures. Cool Edit is also intended to modify a voice or sound effect rendered with different effects. SwissMax and ProgoldShow are used in rendering animations such images, text and graphics. These modified data are exported to Macromedia FlashMX then FlashMX manipulates all these imported data into one synchronized output. The combination of these data using synthetic software would produce
reliable, efficient and robust output of developing and implementing the NORMISIST Profile using multimedia presentation.",normisist profile multimedia presentation using synthetic softwaredeveloping

DIODE TESTING ASSEMBLE: A TOOL FOR VERIFYING DIODE CHARACTERISTICS,"Diode Characteristic Tester is an electronic device which measures the different parameters of the Diodes. It figures out the ability of the diode to withstand beyond its limitations set by the manufacturing semiconductor industry. It must observe that the busted diode will not always be seen in physical conditions; instead, its internal performances will matter. Through the use of this newly designed tester, the internal behavior of the diode can be defined and exemplified. Although there are some existing diode testers which are available, the system used will be accounted as the primary difference. Existing diode testers have a very big difference in terms of cost and size. It is almost three times larger compared to this newly designed tester. Another downside is the complexity of the design which requires the expertise before it can be well operated. In this design, the testing mechanism relies on the three major components. These are the Microcontroller, Current Sensor, and the DC-DC Converter. The microcontroller is the Arduino Atmega328 version 3 which serves as the main tester that will read the parameters of the specific diode characteristics through its analog pins. The Current Sensor will amplify the small leakage current from the diode under the Reverse Bias condition. The amplification part is needed since the microcontroller cannot read a very small voltage. The last part is the DC-DC converter which converts the 300 Volts supply into 5 Volts since the microcontroller can read up to this range only. As the supply voltage approaches to zero, the read voltage from the converter that will be fed to the microcontroller will also approach to zero. Then, all the data was displayed through an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). Based on the result, the value measured using the newly designed tester was almost similar to the value measured using the Digital tester with a percentage of 95%, 99%, and 95.4% for the Forward Voltage Test, Reverse Voltage Test, and Reverse Current Test respectively. This was done using the T- Test method to show the similarity between the two testers in terms of reading the value.

DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER LABORATORY ATTENDANCE MONITORING AND FILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN CARAGA STATE UNIVERSITY,"Disseminating and collecting laboratory activities is one of the hard task for the faculty instead by using the flash drives or other devices for distributing. And in time for checking the attendance, it is difficult for monitoring the students who are being late and absent. This study developed a web-based computer laboratory attendance monitoring and file management system. This system helps the faculty upload laboratory activities for the students, can assign grade with each laboratory activities and monitors the attendance of the students who are being late and absent in class and when the student comes late to the class this will be automatically marked as late. The researcher conducted a survey from 12 respondents, 10 students and 2 instructors in the computer laboratory in CSU. The researchers achieved to lessen the time for the instructor for disseminating and collecting the laboratory activities whenever an activity in computer laboratories takes place. The student downloads and submit the laboratory activities and also takes the attendance by scanning their QR code. In survey result, the researcher computed and tallied the data. The overall result was 82.5 percent in effectiveness and ease of use with the equivalent descriptive rating of strongly agree.

OCR BASED AUTOMATED EVALUATION OF TEST QUESTIONNAIRES,"Educators have long been using written examination in assessing students performances. Even if there are already available online platforms made to automate test and evaluation, there are still valid reasons for not adopting them. With the advent of new technology like image processing, automation can be done to minimize the time consumed in checking a vast number of test questionnaires. The system was designed to recognize handwritten answers from the test questionnaires, which can be generated by the system through a desktop application. The types of test that the system can cater is limited to multiple choice and true or false only. Several optical character recognition (OCR) techniques for image enhancement like grayscale conversion and histogram equalization and Tesseract for character recognition was applied to match the student's answers from the teacher's answer key to obtain the desired results. After evaluating all the answered test questionnaires, item analysis report can also be generated. A total of twenty test questionnaires with five questions in each type were created to identify if the method applied was efficient in the real-life scenario. The researcher can conclude that the system can significantly recognize handwritten answers from the scanned test questionnaires, but the accuracy depends on the quality of printing, scanning orientation, and student's penmanship.

DOCUMENT TAGGING THROUGH UTILIZATION OF OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION (OCR) TECHNOLOGY,"Establishing sufficient support documents in preparation for program accreditation is an essential endeavor any organization partakes and Caraga State University (CSU) is one. However, due to the large volume of documents generated every day, document tagging becomes tedious and the process of classifying document as to whether or not it is the right support document for a specific benchmark statement in the AACCUP OBQA Survey Instrument takes time and expertise to complete. To address this issue, this study developed a system that automatically tags a document to an Area and Parameter in the AACCUP OBQA Survey Instrument. The system utilizes the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Technology to scan and read documents in pdf-format and the application Fuzzywuzzy to compare the converted texts to the predetermined dataset (set of rules for document classification). The system-generated document classification results were compared to that of a Human (Accreditation in-charge) and both machine and human output yielded a 100% match. This result indicates that this study contributes to the enhancement of the current document collection of CSU and a baseline structure towards smarter document tagging system.

ROOM-OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING ALGORITHM ON OBJECCT-ORIENTED CLASS SCHEDULING SYSTEM,"Every now and then, technology evolves and develops. The advancement of the class scheduling of the institution is the focused of this study. This seeks to examine the current manual system of the institution to suggest an upgraded system that will improve the scheduling process. It can be observed and stated that the scheduling technique of the institution is still inefficient, inaccurate and slow. Many problems have been observed when assigning the subject, faculty and time to a particular room which should consider room priority, capacity, type and availability. Thus, we change the manual system into computer-based system. The system will be called ""Room-Object Relational Mapping Algorithm - Object Relational Class Scheduling System (RORMA-ORCSS). This will provide an algorithm that will assign a room efficiently, accurately and fast. The manual system is used only by the institution when there is a possibility that it can cause some errors on assigning a room such as class schedule. The program is not a user-friendly software; it will require a knowledgeable person who knows the scheduling process. This will also require the technique of parallel computing so that the process can be implemented faster because the more courses are offered, the more subjects will need to be scheduled.",roomobject

VALUABLE PRODUCTS GENERATED FROM ELECTRONIC WASTE IN BUTUAN CITY,"E-Waste could also be a source of precious metals which proves by the study of Zhang (2008) from WEEE states that it was possible to recover valuable precious metals such as Platinum, Gold, Silver, Rhodium, Palladium. Steel, most frequently recovered (in amount about 50%) but aluminum so was (from 10 to 30 %) and copper and its alloy (from 15 to 45%). However, despite its advantage it also contained hazardous substances that could harm human health and the environment especially when a particular state or country does not imposed an electronic waste management. The said lethal constituent will be discussed thoroughly on the next chapter and its risky effect. In terms of global electronic waste statistic, a United Nation's global E-waste monitor 2017 concluded that the quantity of the e-waste generation in 2016 was around 44,7 million metric tons (M.), or 61 kg per inhabitant. It was estimated that in 2017, the world e-waste generation would exceed 46Mt and was expected to grow to 52.2 Mt in 2021, with annual growth rate of 3 to 4 %. With the 44.7 Mt e-waste generated in 2016, only 20% (8.9 MI) was documented to be collected and properly recycled, while 80% (30.8 M) was not documented (4% thrown into residual waste, 76% unknown). With this, the researchers provide basic procedures using Design Thinking Model to encourage Butuan City community to recycle their own electronic waste into valuable product.

VOTING VERIFICATION THROUGH FACE RECOGNITION USING ANDROID APPLICATION,"Face recognition is a biometric technology that can be applied to the various fields in terms of human verification. The continued development of technology, face recognition is one most adopted in the latest technologies such as android devices, are applied to complete the job. There are many techniques in recognizing the face image and algorithms applied. The method that is being used in this paper is a pixel based technique where it undergoes process to measure the important features. Important face features are being stored in a database where it would also be used for recognizing. The recognition rate decreases if the distance of the camera between registration and recognition are of great difference.

GENERATION OF TRIPLET LOSS FUNCTION TO ENHANCE THE ACCURACY OF CCIS FACULTY RECOGNITION,"Face Recognition System is a biometric software application capable of uniquely identifying or verifying a person by comparing and analyzing the patterns based on the person's facial features. The accuracy of recognizing the person's face is an essential factor in face recognition systems. This study focused on the application of face recognition methods used in FaceNet by enhancing the approach using feature extraction, embedding. and applying the Triplet Less Function to calculate distance. The idea is to extract the facial feature of the given elliptical mask of the CCIS faculty. The extracted feature is the input value for generating the embedding into 128-dimensional vector. Consequently, the distance of the embedded similar and non-similar images were calculated using the triplet loss function. The resulting output of the algorithm clustered the similar images and secluded the non-similar images. This approach resulted to high accuracy rate of CCIS faculty recognition yielding a 96.45% accuracy rating. Using 26 classes of images and a total of 619 images used in training This model proved the high accuracy rate of recognition based only on the given data set and results during the test validation

USING REAL-TIME COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHM IN FACE LOG-IN AND FACE TRACKING FOR INFORMATION SYSTEM,"Face tracking and recognition is an active and developing field. This plays the vital role in human-computer interaction in real world computing edge. The human face is central to our identity. It plays an essential role in everyday interaction, communication and other routine activities. Detection and tracking of the human face and its features thus potentially opens a very wide range of applications This study uses the real time computer vision Fisher Face algorithm for face recognition and Viola-Jones or haar cascades for face detection and tracking of employee'ser for Information system. The detected user face image will undergo through preprocessing techniques such as cropping, converting to gray scale, bilateral filtering and histogram equalization, to improve the brightness of the image and to reduce the noise of the image. The recognized and verified user will be mapped in the Information System user database according to its user's role and log-in its specific form in the system. The output of mapping user identification is affected based on the result of recognition. The recognition rate of the image goes up and down it depends on how noisy the image and the system environment Keyword Geometric Transformation, Preprocessing Techniques, Histogram

SUITABILITY MAPPING OF ADLAI (COIX LACRYMA JOB L.) USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM IN BUTUAN CITY,"Food crisis in the country is getting worse as soaring prices of rice and com make matters rough. One of the potential crop the Government is looking is the Adlai (Cor Lacryma- Jobi L.) boping it will provide the alternative staple food for the nation. The effectiveness of GIS finds the researcher to manipulate and locate suitable area for adai Spatial analysis involving Geographic Information System (GIS) allows the creation of detailed and accurate suitability maps based on biophysical characteristics of the area and plant characteristics. The study aims to provide information on the suitability of adai in different land area of Butuan City. In order to implement the objectives, the parameters being considered are soil type, elevation and topography, and temperature. The tolerance of the plant in different aspects shows that it can survive in different area in a wide range The output map shows the union of all the criteria and suggests that the majority of the area was considered as moderately suitable area and it is safe to say that majority of Butuan City area is a moderately suitable area for Adlai Keywords: Adla, GIS, spatial analysis",suitability

FILLSECURE: A SEAMLESS AND SECURED FILLING-UP FORMS IN SMARTPHONE USING ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOSYSTEM,"Forms are ubiquitous and almost organization use it for transactions. Some form are distributed and filled up on papers and keep it as a document. As the technology evolves, electronically distributed forms is introduce as the new way of filling up forms. Most of this form are online platform that run through web browser using HTML, where you can access it any time you want. Some people used Desktop run browser to access the online form or even Laptops and or the most famous handheld device known as Smartphones. However, filling up of forms using handheld devices such as smartphone is cumbersome and time consuming. It is highly favorable to have a new platform and mechanism address that concern with security features to ensure confidentiality and privacy in compliance to national and international regulations. In order to address the problem, we need to design and develop a new platform of seamless data entry of form using subsequent representation of personal data sheet into QR-Codes which will be used to fill up the form automatically. The form will be securely transmitted using asymmetric cryptosystem (RSA Algorithm). All the information will be keep as QR Code form embedded with a public key, that key will be the bases to communicate the particular application for encrypting the information before sending. Only the private key of recipient is capable to decrypt the information before it will be stored on their data storage device. The application for this research will be used to ease the bothersome transaction in filling-up forms using smartphone. Security features are strictly implemented from its data foundation to data distribution in order for the smartphone user to have an information privacy and secured.

"DESIGN, FABRICATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF AN ELECTRONIC FRY COUNTER","Fry industry as part of aquaculture is significant to the economic development of the Philippines. The fish farmers currently adopting the manual means of counting amidst the existence of automatic counting machines. Economic cost is the reason of not adopting the new technology. Hence, there is a need to design and fabricate an automatic machine that is affordable. The researchers designed, fabricated, and evaluated the performance of the electronic fry counter in terms of efficiency, capacity and mortality rate of the fry. Sixty (60) pieces of tilapia fry were used as sample for the testing and data gathering. Discharge was used as treatment in the study since it can highly affect the performance of the machine. The computed F value shows that discharge 2 (0.025 L/s) has high significant difference between the treatments based on the number of error. In terms of capacity, the three fry counting methods shows significant difference and the fry counter had the highest capacity of 69 fry per minute with a 98% counting efficiency and 0% mortality rate. Economic analysis also supports that electronic fry counter is advantageous and profitable for it has 173.29% ROR and a payback period of 0.52 years.Keywords: Fry counter, light level sensor,

"TOWARDS THE REPRESENTATION OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, ACTIVITIES AND PROJECTS FOR GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT COMPLIANCE USING XML TECHNOLOGIES","Gender and Development (GAD) is a perspective that aims to integrate gender awareness and competency into mainstream development, given that development activities can have different impacts on women and men. This perspective was introduced the Philippines in the early 1990s and enacted in laws as well as created policies aimed at addressing gender issues within their sectors by integrating government agencies and local government units into regular programs, activities and projects (PAPS). Currently, the government is facing problems in implementing GAD budgetary compliance in terms of allocation, PAPS that are measured in the context of completion and results. Thus, this study was conducted to standardize the representation of all elements in GAD planning for government organizations specifically State University and Colleges through the development of a web application for GAD Compliance Tools (GCT) that will accurately generate the programmable amount for GAD PAPS through the concept of GAD attribution. This will be achieved by using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) technologies. The web application will serve as a tool for evaluating and assessment of GAD PAPS for attribution process. This will automate the current process making it convenient and easy to manage Keywords: GAD, Gender Mainstreaming, GAD Tools, XML., Decision Tree",towards representation government program activity

VICINITY MAP USING SCALABLE VECTOR GRAPHICS,"Google Maps Android API, you can add maps based on Google Maps data to your application. The API automatically handles access to Google Maps servers, data downloading, map display, and response to map gestures. Drawing to view is a better option when your UI does not require dynamic changes in the application. The most convenient aspect of doing so is that the Android framework will provide you with a pre- defined Canvas to which you will place your drawing calls.. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is defined by XML format. Unlike bitmap image formats such as JPG or PNG, it does not consist of a fixed set of dots, but of shapes and their attributes, so it can be saved as the smallest size possible. No matter how large the graphic gets, the XML that describes the graphic is the only thing transmitted to the client. Android development faces different limitations inside in its software development kit with the help of different developers they created open source libraries to defeat this limitations. Google App Engine applications are easy to create, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as your traffic and data storage needs change. With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain.

ROUTE MAPPING WITH ADJACENT PROXIMITY PLACES INVENTORY USING REST-BASED WEB SERVICES,"Google Maps API provides services that help users to retrieve spatial information on the map based on the location of the device, like, searching nearby hotels, restaurants, tourist spot, etc. Dependency on these services has increased dramatically due to the wide availability of laptops, smart phones and tablets. However, directions and searching places in Google maps are two separate application instances. Moreover, routes are set by the apps automatically where users could not define a preferred path. Thus, addressing this application constraint will improve the services into one context of direction and search places in one interface. The study have develop an application that formulate a route and search its places within the desired proximity adjacent to the path as a mashup service using google rest-based web services.

INTERACTIVE FLOOD PRONE AREA MAPPING IN BUTUAN CITY,"Heavy monsoon rainfall has triggered floods in Butuan City as well as in different parts of the country. The flood cost thousands of pesos, property and many lives. Floods are considered to be one of the weather-related natural disasters. This study presents Interactive Flood Prone Area Mapping in Butuan City using an open source GIS, statistical analysis and Object Oriented Programming. By employing geospatial analysis using the open source GIS software, the Butuan barangay boundary map, built up area and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data of Butuan City in order to determine elevation and distance to river the two determinants to flood risk. The fusion of the object-oriented programming for the development of (GUI) Graphical User Interface makes the system more manageable and easy to use for flood mapping applications.

VISUALZING PLANTILLA POSITION PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL DATA IN ACADEMIC TITLES,"Human Resource Management Services (HRMS) are concerned with managing personnel in the context of the employer-employee relationship. One of their functions is to monitor the performance of the employees. The study needs an established performance appraisal system (PAS) that visualizes the performance summary for each regular teaching personnel since HRMS has no bundled design or data visualization for performance appraisal. The proponents use the Django framework and other technology tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Chart.js to create the web-based system. These technologies help with data manipulation and visualization. Django is a robust and flexible framework that allows programmers to develop high-quality web applications efficiently and securely, which is advantageous in terms of scalability, security, and versatility. The instrument of this study is the Individual Performance Commitment and Review (IPCR) stated in the Caraga State University Strategic Performance Management System (CSU-SPMS) policy manual. The office of Caraga State University Human Resource Management Services (CSU HRMS) uses this instrument to monitor their employees' performance, especially regular teaching personnel. The proponents achieved the objectives where they have developed the Caraga State University Performance Appraisal System (CSU-PAS) that visualizes plantilla position in academic titles. Furthermore, the system indicates the number of regular teaching personnel per adjectivel rating. Moreover, the system displays the employee in descending order from highest to lowest numerical rating. The study is limited to teaching personnel, and the next version may include nonteaching personnel.

LOCATION VOTING FACILITIES IN SHARING PRESENTATION DISPLAY MANAGEMENT,"In a classroom-learning situation, learning the stages of information of the lesson is the fundamental component to fully realize and appreciate the lesson. However, there are students with difficulties in learning the lesson especially when the instructor is not aware of the quickness of the teaching. The Location Voting Facility in Sharing Presentation Display Management provides a tool that enables the students to cast votes to each slide presentation discussed if the discussion should proceed to the next slide or to repeat the earlier discussion. It also has a facility that shares the PowerPoint presentation from the server to any platform of devices through Aspose.Slides accordingly, students can download the PowerPoint presentation in their devices. After the presentation the report of the duration of time in each slides discussed is generated in the server. The system is also facilitated with chat application of the client and the server. The Socket.io, a web socket JavaScript library of Node.js was used to build the real-time voting application facility of the system. Result of the real-time voting of the students is generated into percentage and visible in the server side of the system. It is also the basis for ruling of the system whether the slide should proceed or repeat.

NORMISIST BUDGET MONITORING SYSTEM,"In Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology, budget unit is the one who handles the allotment of money as well as the recording of expenditures. The allotment for programs, projects and activities of this Institute are coming from the national government through the General Appropriations Act (GAA) as well as from the Institute's Income Generating Project (IGP). However, the current budget monitoring process shows some problems that contribute to the inefficiency of monitoring budget transactions. In order to provide better performance in budget management, the current way of monitoring budget allotments should be further developed into a well organized and efficient one. Through the development of an automated Budget Monitoring System, hassle of record processing is minimized. This proposed system is indeed a useful tool in managing daily transactions since it allows tracking of files and automatic generation of reports. However, this study focuses only in the making of obligations. The study of the processing of budget utilization request is highly recommended.",normisist budget monitoring systemin northern mindanao state institute science technology budget unit one handle

A DESIGN ON BUTUAN BUS CONTROL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,"In this paper we present a novel approach to integrate RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) in WSN (Wireless sensor network). WSN is used to support RFID identification process by extending the read range of an RFID system. Besides, by the use of the WSN we can monitor the environment of an object and optimize RFID reader's performance and energy. Then, methodology to integrate RFID technology, wireless sensor network to form an intelligent bus tracking application is studied. The proposed system can monitor bus traffic inside spacious bus stations, and can inform administrates whether the bus is arriving on time, early or late. This information is then displayed on the different wireless displays inside and outside the bus station.

A 10 PESO ATTRIBUTE CLASSIFIER FOR COIN DETECTION,"In this paper, the proponents proposed a detection and recognition system of the Philippine 10 peso coin. In this research, Haar-like features was used for building the classifier for the coin detection and recognition. It applies the Gentle AdaBoost Algorithm (GAB), one of AdaBoost Algorithm, which can build a strong classifier. Several samples of positive and negative images are collected for training purposes. The positive images were used as sample images for training the classifier which a machine needs to be detected and recognized while the negative images are used as background images. After the training, the built classifier was used for the detection and recognition of the 10 peso coin. During the system testing, it was able to detect and recognized several 10 peso coins. As recorded by the proponents, out of ninety-two (92) 10 peso coins, eighty-five (85) 10 peso coins was detected and recognized. The detection and recognition system has a total of 93% accuracy as computed by the proponents based on the system testing. Thus, the proponents conclude that detecting and recognizing the 10 peso coin using Haar-like feature was indeed possible.

A SYSTEM DESIGN ON ONLINE PROCESSING CIVIL REGISTRY DOCUMENTS (CRD'S) FROM LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRAR OFFICERS (LCRO'S) INTO PSA-NSO PROVINCIAL OFFICE AGUSAN DEL NORTE,"In this paper, the researcher presented a new system design of An Online Processing of Civil Registry Documents from Local Civil Registrar Offices to PSA-NSO Provincial Office Agusan del Norte to help the staff of PSA-NSO LCRO's, PSA-NSO Provincial Office of Agusan del Norte, and PSA-NSO Central in processing and generation of its Certificate of Registry Documents by applying databases for coding schemes and tabulations of CoLB, COM, CoD, and CoFD. This system is an all-embracing Information Technology solution to cover all data processing activities of CRD-COLB, COM, COD, and COFD from data entry, validation, completeness check, compilation, and tabulation up to maintenance of data files. The system intends to solve the problems of manual processes of the statisticians and produce provincial tabulations. The user can choose different areas, level, period of time and other options to be considered in generation of statistical tables. Submission of CRD-COLB, COM, CoD, and CoFD from LCRO's ca now be easily transmitted thru Electronic, which is integrated into the system, provided the computer unit used is connected to the Internet. The data will be imported form CRD's type of the CoLB, COM, COD, and CoFD. The system has the capacity to extract the data from the CRD's forms to the processing sheet forms in Visual Basic 6.0. This process is found in the databases of coding schemes. The system has also the capability to show and provide all things needed by the user as far as data processing is concerned such as printing of forms and browsing reference files Keywords: Philippine

A SYSTEM DESIGN ON ONLINE PROCESSING OF CIVIL REGISTRY DOCUMENTS (CRDâs) FROM LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRAR OFFICES(LCROâs) INTO RSA NSO PROVINCIAL OFFICE AGUSAN DEL NORTE,"In this paper, the researcher presented a new system design of An Online Processing of Civil Registry Documents from Local Civil Registrar Offices to PSA-NSO Provincial Office Agusan del Norte to help the staff of PSA-NSO LCRO's, PSA-NSO Provincial Office of Agusan del Norte, and PSA-NSO Central in processing and generation of its Certificate of Registry Documents by applying databases for coding schemes and tabulations of COLB, COM, CoD, and CoFD. This system is an all-embracing Information Technology solution to cover all data processing activities of CRD-COLB, COM, COD, and COFD from data entry, validation, completeness check, compilation, and tabulation up to maintenance of data files. The system intends to solve the problems of manual processes of the statisticians and produce provincial tabulations. The user can choose different areas, level, period of time and other options to be considered in generation of statistical tables. Submission of CRD-COLB, COM, CoD, and CoFD from LCRO's can now be easily transmitted thru Electronic, which is integrated into the system, provided the computer unit used is connected to the Internet. The data will be imported form CRD's type of the COLB, COM, COD, and CoFD. The system has the capacity to extract the data from the CRD's forms to the processing sheet forms in Visual Basic 6.0. This process is found in the databases of coding schemes. The system has also the capability to show and provide all things needed by the user as far as data processing is concerned such as printing of forms and browsing reference files.

STUDENT COURSE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM VIA SMS,"In this paper, the researchers present a way to bring information to students by leveraging the availability of mobile phones. The researchers review the use of mobile phones for delivering announcements via short messaging service (SMS) in Caraga State University, where student is mostly from different remote areas in the region. The student course notification via SMS is a way to provide a service for faculty to send their class announcements faster and cost effective. This paper begins by studying two common techniques of class announcements through Web Application and SMS Transaction. This study uses a Nokia model 8210 with generic USB to IrDA Bridge to connect to the PC. The SMS alert tool seeks only to provide an alternative method so that information dissemination can be hastened. It is built on Nokia PC Connectivity SDK (version 3.0), it is coded in Visual Basic 6.0 and the interface is coded in PHP. From time to time, the SMS Alert Program will intercept if there is an incoming SMS. For every valid SMS transaction, it means a message is subject for SMS alert to the specific recipients. System alert is completed by updating the announcement files storage with the status ""waiting"", which means that its alert was still in process of sending otherwise it was already sent. By developing an SMS notification for a university, it will be beneficial for the students and faculty because they can communicate, share information and references that will be beneficial to their subjects.

ADVISORY SYSTEM ON THE SUITABILITY OF RICE VARIETIES,"In this paper, the researchers presented an advisory system mainly to the farmers by applying the availability of mobile phones and web-based application. The researchers present this study to address the problems of rice production mainly in Caraga Region, where farmers are mostly from different remote areas. The advisory system on the suitability of rice varieties via SMS and Web are ways to provide service for farmers to acquire advises on proper rice farming management with the dialect that they understand and to know the rice varieties suitability in their specific lands in a faster and cost effective way. This paper begins by studying two common techniques of disseminating advices and recommendation through Web Application and SMS Transaction. This study uses Huawei model E303 as SMS Gateway to connect to the PC. The SMS alert tool seeks only to provide an alternative method so that information dissemination can be hastened. It is built on SMSLibx 2.6 that is coded in Visual Basic 6.0. For the web, the researchers used Joomla 1.5as the interface with the default interface of Expert System. The researchers use the e2gRule Writer for web-based development. From time to time, the SMS alert program will intercept if there is an incoming SMS. For every SMS transaction, an auto reply will be made that will be send to the recipients whether valid or invalid format. Every valid SMS it will be saved directly to the database for storing the data.

DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING BASED ROBOTIC ARM CONTROL SIMULATION TO EXECUTE OBJECT REACHING TASK FOR INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION,"In this thesis, a deep reinforcement learning approach was proposed to train a simulated robot arm to perform object reaching tasks. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm was utilized and various reward functions were explored using data from distance sensors, a camera, and an object recognition node attached to the robot arm gripper. The simulation environment was created using the open-source platform Webots and its implementation of a custom gym environment from OpenAl Gym, in conjunction with the reinforcement learning library StableBaseline3. The results revealed that the developed robotic arm controller performed well in terms of convergence and the number of steps required to learn an optimal policy, with the use of reward shaping found to aid in improving the learning process. The goal of the research was to simplify the implementation of robotics in industrial settings by using deep reinforcement learning as an alternative to task specific programming.

SELECTION OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS USING KNUTH-MORRIS-PRATT ALGORITHM,"Increasing competition in global markets urges organizations to put more emphasis on paper personnel selection process. Organizations and companies succeed or fail, base on the quality and effectiveness of their employees. Successful recruitment begins with proper employment planning and forecasting. Related to the success of recruitment process are the strategies an organization is ready to employ in order to identify and select the best candidates for its developing pool of human resources. This paper presents an approach of selecting personnel using natural language interface for the user to interact with the system. The user may input his/her queries in natural language likely in English statement. The proposed model uses a natural language interface to database with integration of Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. The algorithm provided in the system gives relevance with the efficient matching of data to the database. Thus, the study plays a significant role on retrieving data with efficiency using the natural language as minimum interaction to the database system. In simulation of the prototype, it shows that developing a natural language interface with KMP satisfies users especially, the casual or non-technical users for selecting qualified personnel.

WEB-BASED MALARIA MONITORING SYSTEM WITH MAPPING CAPABILITY,"Keeping records, creating reports and retrieving records of the patient is crucial when it is done in paper works and the monitoring of malaria high risk areas in Marihatag, Surigao Del Sur. This study illustrated a technique of integrating Geographical Information System (GIS), Google Application Programming Interface (API) Technology and Automation of creating of reports, monitoring and mapping of malaria prevalence through an interactive user interface.Fusion Table supported GIS by converting shp file (shapefile format) into kml in order to express visualization within web-based and two-dimensional maps. Since the Google Fusion Table has the ability to generate html code to display creative and interactive map, it enabled access of map by embedding this html code into the web page created for this web mapping service. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the web-based system was developed and programmed in PHP and Javascript language.

"AN AUTOMATED LAND CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT AND MAPPING SCHEME AT MACALANG BUENAVISTA, AGUSAN DEL NORTE","Land Capability Assessment and Mapping Scheme of an area is one of the requirements to achieve best possible utilization of a farming land resource for sustainable agricultural production. It corresponds to different criterion: productivity of component species in the relation to the bio- physical environment and resources of the site; adaptability of the farmer's technical skills and capabilities, and its sustainability. However, defining its capability to define land use system and support crops characteristics for good production is difficult without its components that will be the basis for a good land use planning. The manual and normal process in assessing land capability and locating its area suitability takes more time to do and is not easy for the expert. This study aims to develop an Automated Land Capability Assessment and Mapping Scheme at Macalang, Buenavista, Agusan del Norte. Barangay Macalang is one of the barangay's belonging to the municipality of Buenavista, Agusan del Norte with 7 puroks. It is plain and hilly and the upper part is mountainous. Barangay Macalang was already studied by the expert and other researcher regarding its land capability assessment. With this, there were already available preliminary data in relation to its bio- physical and socio-economic characteristics. The application of Information Technology had been a great help in automating the knowledge of an expert. With the use of EXSYS Corvid Servlet Runtime, data of the selected crop and forest tree species, with its corresponding selected bio-physical characteristics such as altitude (elevation), soil pif, soil type, temperature, and rainfall requirements are manipulated for assessing land capability. And with the used of Geographical Information System, identifying crop suitability in a specific area can be easilylocated. The output of the developed system entitled, An Automated Land Capability and Mapping Scheme at Macalang, Buenavista, Agusan del Norte, was agreed by the agro foresters in Caraga State University and students who are knowledgeable about the content of the study. Furthermore, survey has been tested to know the perception of the respondents with regards to the system using the system weighted mean formula.

CSU KLINIK-KONEK APPOINTMENT SYSTEM INTEGRATED WITH VIDEO CONFERENCE,"Life is getting hard and unsafe because of the pandemic we are currently experiencing. It is difficult to make in-person appointments for medical treatment. The internet and new technologies are used to facilitate these online medical appointments within the university. Nowadays, the internet has become a trustworthy source for almost every type of information. Individuals are becoming more open to the possibility of replacing a visit to a physical facility with an online option, believing that an online appointment and consultation have established a foothold in the market. The major goal of this study is to make it easier and more convenient for patients to book appointments with doctors, as well as to address the issues that patients have when scheduling appointments in person. To realize this concept, full system research and investigation were conducted, and data about the current system were collected and analyzed utilizing document and data flow diagrams. The CSU Klinik-Konek Appointment System Integrated with Video Conference Design is a web-based clinical consultation that can be used in place of the face-to-face or traditional consultations at the clinic of Caraga State University main campus. The system will facilitate appointment reservations and save a large number of patients' information through this simple system design, using auto-email notifications to confirm that the client's request has been reserved or booked. This system will be a big improvement over the manual system currently employed in the university clinic. Patients are able to access the page as long as there is an internet connection for online booking. It will also help to minimize the risk of university students and employees from contracting the COVID-19 virus. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the use of the Likert Scales approach was being used to design this system. Finally, the design is visualized by using data flow, entity- relationship diagrams, and a prototyping tool like UiZard.

DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM: A TOOL FOR CARAGA STATE UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT ANALYSIS,"Many organizations have introduced computer-based Information systems to support business processes and provide information to its members. However the way that information flows in the organizations has changed, it is now possible to grant access to more people and encourage information sharing and cooperation. The new strategy around information and processes allows performing tasks simultaneously and speeding up decision making. Decision Support Systems (DSS) has become a tool that helps managers of different levels in the organization to perform their roles on monitoring. planning, forecasting and analysis. The Caraga State University, Ampayon, Butuan City has been managing various curricular programs since school year 1977-1978. With its existence, the researchers believe that a decision support system that is capable of analyzing enrollment records must be developed. A support system capable of interactively analyzing, exploring. summarizing records and returns filtered reports, patterns, trends and even predicts future values. With that, the researchers developed a decision support system that will assist the administrators on their decision-making and planning preparation regarding the selected programs offered by the College of Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT).

CSU GUIDANCE OFFICE EVENTS AND SERVICES ONLINE SCHEDULING SYSTEM WITH TWO-WAY SMS NOTIFICATION AND INQUIRY SYSTEM,"Many organizations have introduced computer-based Information systems to support business processes and provide information to its members. However the way that information flows in the organizations has changed, it is now possible to grant access to more people and encourage information sharing and cooperation. The new strategy around information and processes allows performing tasks simultaneously and conveniently. The CSU Guidance Office and Testing Center has been providing various kinds of events and services to help students adopt in the new environment as they take their way being a college student. With its existence, the researchers believe that an information system that is capable of easily posting of events and services schedules online must be developed. An information system capable of giving students additional options in knowing and viewing the events and services schedules and in addition giving students notification in case that they cannot view the schedules online. With that, the researchers developed an information system that will assist the Guidance Counselors post their events and services schedules online, give SMS notification and a SMS inquiry system.

TRANSECT RESOURCE MAP GENERATOR: A SPATIAL 2D TO 1D CONVERSION TOOL,"Maps are widely used nowadays to address Disasters Risk Reduction and in any environment related initiatives, as a medium for management and decision making, however, the utilization of 2D maps limits and makes it impossible to account the resources and elevation, distributed across the area. Thus, limits the information and deducted decision that can be captured out from it. This research introduced methods of using the concept of Transect Walk or Community Mapping for a spatial 2D to ID conversion. The research utilized NAMRIA Resource Map and DEM as an input datasets. GIS technology and techniques was utilized for the preparation of data, and MATLAB for pixel and matrix manipulation for the generation of Transect Resource Map. Both DEM and Resource Map were interpolated to establish the relationship that both data point to the same location. Elevation Profiling and Resource Inventory were then conducted for the generation of the transect resource map. The resulting figure and conversion of 2D to ID representation was indeed made possible, and the visualization addressed the limitations of 2D representation and was a good supplementary tool for decision making anything related to understanding the terrain in relation to elevation and resources.

AUTOMATIC METADATA CREATION OF BOOKS USING OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION,"Metadata is information used to describe a set of data. Organizing articles by their metadata is seen as one of the foreboding challenges confronting every people involved in any educational and library transactions. However, the process of creating metadata manually is expensive, labor-extensive and time-consuming for a large collection, thus, the costs for manual metadata creation makes a great inspiration for automatically creating metadata of books. In this paper, the built application is able to extract keywords from captured book title page and search it on Amazon using some image enhancement techniques, Tesseract OCR Engine, spelling correction algorithm called Levenshtein Edit Distance Algorithm and with the help of human interaction. Quantitative results are shown for the text extraction and spelling correction experiments. However, the 87.61% text extraction accuracy is still subject for improvements. Thus, spelling correction was conducted and yield 71.92% accuracy rate. With the help of the spelling correction algorithm, the keyword extraction accuracy had increased from 87.61% to 96.52%. To create metadata, the corrected keywords were used to search books on Amazon and the relevant search query was in the form of MARC metadata. A theoretical analysis, backed by a series of experiments and testing, indicates that automatic metadata creation using Optical Character Recognition was indeed possible.

SURFACE WATER TREATMENT (EX SITU): REDUCING TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS USING CORN SEED AS BIOCOAGULANT,"Mining projects are potential sources of soil and sediment eroding into and degrading surface water quality. Such problems are mitigated by different kinds of water treatment like coagulation. This study utilizes Zea maize or commonly called as com as an effective coagulant for treating mine wastewater from Taganito Mining Corporation and Greenstone Resources Corporation, specifically reducing TSS of the sample water. The coagulant was extracted from a mixture of a 20g com powder and 50 ml. distilled water to produce a com coagulant solution. Preparing seven 500 ml. beakers filled with 450 ml. of surface water sample. Six beakers were treated with the com coagulant while one beaker remained as a blank sample. Results show that, pH, temperature, conductivity, TDS, DO and orp of the wastewater were not affected by the com coagulant solution. TSS % reductions of the treated samples were 95.07% and 96.22 % for 5 and 10 drops of dosage. Corn is a good coagulant, however, it turned to be uneconomical since blank sample's TSS % reduction was 94,93%. Thus, ordinary settling process is enough and com coagulant is not desirable in TMC wastewater. On the other hand, treated waters that were gathered at Greenstone Resources Corporation (GRC) shows a positive result of corn effectiveness. After an hour, highest TSS % reduction of treated sample was 76.62 % while blank sample remains turbid having 15.66 %. In addition, used com could be recycled up to four times with almost the same efficiency of fresh solutions prepared. TSS of treated waters of optimum dosage was classified as Class A up to Class D, thus it",surface water treatment ex situ reducing total suspended solid using corn seed biocoagulantmining project

INTEGRATION OF SPEECH RECOGNITION FOR ACADEMIC MONITORING SYSTEM,"Monitoring the instructional progress of the lecturer is an aspect to produce a quality education institution, as they play a vital role in the learning development of the students. However, the current monitoring for the lecturer was done traditionally where there is involvement to the Department heads and chairman. This study aims to automate the current way of monitoring of the lecturers teaching progress through the integration of speech recognition. The monitoring is done using the voice input of the lecturer and convert it to text using a DeepSpeech model and identifies the possible topic using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm which is used to match to the subject syllabi. A 79.4% average accuracy rate was achieved on the speech to text conversion using the DeepSpeech model. For the matching a week's score was generated to represent the number of matched keywords from a text file and the syllabus. In this paper the researchers have developed a method to automate the monitoring of the faculty's teaching progress using the Automatic Speech Recognition and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF AN AUTOMATED STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE MONITORING SYSTEM FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNIT OF ROSARIO AGUSAN DEL SUR,"Most companies and agencies have an office evaluation through regular basis in a year. Office evaluation depends on the output of every offices accomplishment plan if they achieve the certain projects or goals that they had come up with. The Strategic Performance Monitoring System applies to output producing units and measures the collective performance of an office based on their outputs with a standard unit of measure. This allows a comparison of performance across offices or functions, and would take into account the productivity and efficiency of an operational unit of the LGU-Rosario. With this, the proponents have come up on a Feasibility Study of an Automated SPMS to determine and examine the factors that hinder and support in terms of the Talents, Resources/Budget, and the Adaption of SPMS Automation in LGU-Rosario, Agusan del Sur. Furthermore, the proponents used survey questionnaires, interviewed the Admin Chiefs and staffs that engaged in SPMS, SWOT Analysis, CSF Analysis, and Statistical Analysis in determining the result of the study. As resulted, shifting their manual process of SPMS to automation is possible and can be implemented based on the overview and overall outcome of the study.

EXTRACTING TIME-ALIGNED TOPIC SEGMENTS FROM THE SPEECH TRANSCRIPT OF VIDEO LECTURES,"Multiple topics are discussed by a lecturer throughout a video lecture. However, t is time-consuming for a student to locate a relevant topic of the lecture by manually viewing the entire video. We aim to develop a framework to divide a video lecture into topic segments and label each segment Topic segments and labels acts as an aid to student learning by helping them navigate to a topic segment on the video. The methods are (1) converting the speech of the lecturer to text using Google Speech API and automatically restoring punctuation using a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network with Attention Mechanism, (1) separating sentences and applying TextTiling algorithm to discover topic segments, (ii) assign a label to each segment by identifying the five most frequent nouns and (iv) scoring each based on its topic similarity to the segment identified by a topic model trained on the entire English Wikipedia using a machine learning algorithm Latest Dirichlet Allocation. Results of speech recognition takes averages to 20 minutes to convert a 1 hour speech to text. Results show discovery of an average of one topic segment per minute and identifying an average of 3 words that are topically related to a segment Keywords: model, segmentation, labeling, duration,

MY PERFORMANCE: A CSU STUDENT COURSE PERFORMANCE WORKFLOW SYSTEM,"My Performance: A CSU Student Course Performance Workflow System was developed using web technologies integrated into a web server. The system was created using Twitter Bootstrap that was supported by HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The Web-Based System was designed and developed by the researchers to be in the future to create a course performance workflow system that will be used by the students and faculties of the Caraga State University. The result of the system usability evaluation was done using a number of respondents. The total computation of the evaluation stated that the thirty respondents agree the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction of the system. The utilization of the Laravel framework and its package certainly helped the development and implementation faster. After being able to achieve all the system objectives, the researchers then concluded that the methodology used by the researcher is sufficient and is able to provide requirements as a base of creating an online course module.

DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HYBRID DATA-SYNCHRONIZATION IN DISTRIBUTED DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,"NORMISIST Computerized Enrollment System helps improve its enrollment system. It minimizes time in processing enrollments. But still, it doesn't achieve the reliability and fast access of the system due to slow response of the queries to the database and server. It posts a concern with its IT infrastructure due to increasing number of enrollees and heavy traffic of SQL queries and response that affect database server and network. This explores the detail to add technology that will help NORMISIST Enrollment System and processes. Establishing a multiple server will help minimize network traffic by allowing users to exercise control over their own data while allowing others to share data from other databases. The goal then is to design Hybrid Data-Synchronization technique that synchronizes updates from client unto servers and techniques that synchronize update when other servers are down. Further, this explores the client/server middleware to come up with an effective and reliable data-synchronizer which enables synchronizations of data and updates in a Distributed Data Environment. Updates from client is then synchronously distributed and reflected among servers in the networks. It achieves reliability and fast access to the database. Client/server is a computational architecture that involves client processes requesting service from server processes. Using Visual Basic Object-Oriented Programming for the application part of the system and the use of ODBC middleware for transparent connection to the database (MySQL).",design implementation hybrid

MEASURING THE OPTIMUM AND EFFICIENT CLIENT-SERVER PERFORMANCE,"Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology as an institution presently adapting client-server technology. It is used to have immediate access in every transaction. NORMISIST in fact has already established a database server and it is being used in enrollment process nowadays. However, with the need to standardize of every school transactions, there is a possibility that the database server will be inefficient in providing fast and reliable data processing. The study of Design of Optimum and Efficient Client-Server Ratio is an effective way to determine the exact ratio of a single database server to its concurrent client. Thus, fast and reliable data processing is achieved. The study was made through MS Visual Basic as a Programming language being used. MS Access as a relational database management system from Microsoft. In addition the idea of client-server technology was also applied. The researcher found out that through this study, database and network administrator with its client could have a good client-server relationship.",measuring optimum efficient clientserver

A KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM ON LAND SUITABILITY ASSESSMENT IN CARAGA,"Nowadays, the population of the Philippines is growing dramatically. In order to meet the increasing demand for the food, the farming community has to increase its production. At present situations, vast lands are one of the factors why most of the Filipinos pursue agri-business. This study was carried out to evaluate the suitability of the agricultural crop to the land characteristics by using a knowledge-base expert system. The factors that were considered for evaluation of the land suitability for crop production were slope, soil drainage, soil texture, soil depth, soil pH and the present crop to be use in the land. This study aims to develop and design a knowledge-based system that will determine the suitable lands for specific crops in Caraga Region and to assist the farmers and experts in land suitability for sustainable agricultural farming by reducing processing time with standardized procedure. The researchers use the Exsys Corvid 3.1.1 for the development of rules and Joomla 1.5 as the user interface. The results of this study are valuable to agriculture and forestry sector, researchers and students.

AN ANALYSIS OF TIDAL CONDITION EFFECTS ON THE 2014 TROPICAL STORM AGATON FLOODING EVENT IN BUTUAN CITY USING GEOSPATIAL AND NUMERICAL MODELING APPROACHES,"On January 2014, heavy to torrential rains brought by Tropical Storm Agaton caused the Agusan River to overflow and inundated localities along the river. One of the heavily affected localities is Butuan City, which is located in the downstream portion of Agusan River near Butuan Bay where the river drains. Although it was reported that flooding was due to the overflowing of the river, it is not yet clear if the level of inundation was affected, or even aggravated by tidal conditions in Butuan Bay. In this study, the researchers conducted an analysis of the effects of tidal conditions on the 2014 Agaton flooding event in Butuan City using a combination of geospatial and numerical modeling approaches. First, they developed and calibrated a hydrologic model using HEC HMS 3.5 to estimate the volume of flood water that enters Butuan City coming from the upstream portion of Agusan River Basin and from other nearby watersheds. Then, they developed a two-dimensional hydraulic model based on HEC RAS 5 to simulate the movement and propagation of flood waters from the upstream, including the rise and fall of water level in Butuan Bay due to tidal effects. The hydraulic model is fed with discharge hydrographs computed by the calibrated hydrologic model, and time series data of tides in Butuan Bay. A separate 2D simulation was implemented wherein flood waters coming from the upstream are allowed to flow freely towards Butuan Bay without tidal effects. For these two simulations, flood depth and hazard maps were generated and analyzed to determine tidal effects on the depth and extent of flooding, including the level impacts to structures with and without consideration of tidal effects. Results show that flood depths and extents simulated by the hydraulic model considering tidal effects have little difference to the simulated results without tidal effects. Our simulations seem to suggest that flooding in Butuan City during Agaton event was not aggravated by tidal condition, and that flooding appears to be mainly due to the long duration and high volume of rainfall brought by TS Agaton, However, the results and conclusions of this study must be taken with caution due to several limitations that may be addressed by future studies.

A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM ON FACULTY MANAGEMENT AND UTILIZATION IN CEIT,"One concern in an educational institution such as the College of Engineering and Information Technology is its faculty distribution, basically per division basis. In this study, a Decision Support System served as a deviation from the accustomed automated input/output processes of academic resources in the educational framework of the college. With this model, the system could be able to generate results from projected and real-time data and compare their deviations to draw significant outcome. Results from the system showed that any difference in the values of projected and actual faculty population in CEIT would generate remarks which would help the decision-maker on his/her analysis. If the projected result is lesser than the actual number of faculty members, the system would prompt an ""excess"" remark, concluding that the college hired faculty members in a particular semester greater than they supposedly need; otherwise ""shortage"" would be reflected. Seldom results of full capacity would result ""ok"" in the system. Faculty members were categorized based on their field of specialization, i.e. the degree they had graduated from. This is the most prevalent case in the faculty admission relationship in CEIT considering IT and other computer and technological courses in CEIT has been increasingly in demand over a period of time.",decision support system faculty management utilization ceitone concern educational institution college engineering information technology faculty distribution basically per division basis study

FACTORS INFLUENCING TRAVELERS' AND MOTORIST' ACCEPTANCE OF INTILLEGENT TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS: A SEM-ANN APPROACH,"One of the main barriers to the growth and transformation of developing countries is traffic congestion. Numerous nations have put in place national smart city programs to enhance business operations, quality of life, and competitiveness. The Sydney Coordinated Adoptive Traffic System, Ride-hailing Services, Motorbike Taxi Services, Traffic Navigators, Waze, and Apple Maps are just a few of the smart transportation applications being implemented, particularly in metro Manila. These advancements and innovations are being implemented and used. However, there has been a dearth of research that examined user behaviors in relation to smart transportation service. This sparked a need for an exploratory research on user behavior when using intelligent transportation systems. In order to assess the adoption of a new technology, the study applies the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the conceptual framework, which has been widely used in previous research. This research also employed a dual-mode survey design, administering online and in-person surveys to a sample of 500 respondents, in order to test the hypotheses of the theoretical model with the use of partial least squares component based structural equation modeling. By utilizing partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), this study sought to determine the factors that impact users' trust and intention to use intelligent transportation applications. The findings showed that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), and trust all had a positive effect on user intention (UI). Among four factors that affect trust, PEU is more potent to influence the respondents of the study to trust artificial intelligent transportation applications. The results of PLS-SEM are further verified through the ANN approach and the results of PLS-SEM and ANN complement each other and produced more thorough results. The researchers believe that this study has provided crucial information to other researchers who are interested in aspects that influence motorists' and travelers' acceptance of intelligent transportation systems.

IMPROVEMENT OF MINE WASTEWATER QUALITY IN MARCVENTURES MINING AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION: COCONUT SHELL CHARCOAL AS AN ADSORBENT AGENT,"One of the most controversial issues nowadays is that some mining companies are subjected for closure due to the proposal of new DENR Secretary Ms. Gina Lopez. One of the environmental issues complained by the people especially by Sec. Lopez is the contamination and discoloration of the water in the rivers, streams, oceans and any watersheds. This study utilizes coconut shell charcoal as an adsorbent agent for improving the mine wastewater of Marcventures Mining and Development Corporation, specifically in improving the selected primary parameters (pH, DO, TD, and TURB). The crushed coconut shell charcoal was sacked with the fine and coarse sand to produce a material that is use for adsorption process in actual experiment. Four gallon of mine wastewater sample was collected for laboratory analysis as alternative method. The results show that all initial and final pH, DO, and TDS passed as Class AA up to Class SD based on Water Quality Guidelines and General Effluent Standards of 2016 (DAO 2016-08). Moreover, the effect of this study on turbidity was clearly a success because the mine wastewater becomes visibly clear. Thus, the discharge could be used for drinking water if it will undergo a thorough process of water treatment and also it can be a good source for fishery, agricultural irrigation and other beneficial use.

2GO RETAIL OUTLET SATISFACTION ON THE COMPANY'S FUNDING PROCESS,"Outlet retailer's satisfaction and service quality are one of the basic opportunities which would help run, improve business processes, profit and loyalty of customers of the 200 company. 200 opens outlet retailers to facilitate passengers' ticket issuance, to update customers for the new schedule of travel without having to go to the main office just to inquire of the schedule status and changes. The researchers specifically addressed the conduct of satisfaction survey on the Funding Processes of the company since it is seen to be the crucial activity between the 200 proprietor and those outlet retailers subscribing to their supply chain solution. Results showed that outlet retailers were satisfied mostly in the funding processes except in the deactivation and reactivation of account. Even though the results were satisfied; it was almost less satisfied based on the interpretation of the weighted mean. With this, the researchers recommend that the company should give early notifications on the outlet retailers who are potential to be deactivated. Out of 20 respondents there are Nine (9) or Forty-Five percent (45%) of outlet retailers are satisfied, while Six (6) or Thirty percent (30%) are less satisfied. Three or Fifteen percent (15%) are not satisfied and Two (2) or Ten percent (1016) are very satisfied in their funding process.

AUTOMATED ON RICE VARIETY IDENTIFICATION,"Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) envisioned to attain rice self-sufficiency by increasing the productivity and profitability of rice farmers in a sustainable and competitive manner but there is no tool that will help rice growers or farmers to support on the decision making when it comes to good selection of rice variety since farmers have difficulty in the appointment for the consultant of rice experts due to the distance of the office of PhilRice. The system which entitled ""Automation on Rice Variety Identification"" is completed and implemented using PHP5, HTML 5, CSS 3 and web programming to facilitate the creation Graphical User Interface (GUI). The study is a rule-based expert system. The researchers have chosen PROLOG to implement the rule-based mode of knowledge representation. SWI-PROLOG was used as the inference engine. It was observed that the designed system functioned with a very high effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy as evidenced by the very high usability result when actual software testing was conducted.

A KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM ON CORN INSECT PESTS AND DISEASES MANAGEMENT,"Plant protection tasks are part of crop management of any crop which need expertise that can be better represented in symbolic knowledge representation schemes rather than other tasks, like cultural practices and fertilization which includes mathematical models more than symbolic knowledge. In addition to that annual yield losses due to pests are estimated to be in billions of dollars worldwide. Therefore, a decision has been taken to develop a Knowledge-based System on Com Insect Pests and Diseases Management to expedite the development and maintenance processes of plant protection expert systems for field crops specifically Com. In analyzing the plant protection task we come up with four sub tasks namely: variety selection, Insect Pests and Diseases identification, cultural practices, Insect Pest diagnosis, and Insect Pest control. This research presents an integration approach involving Artificial Intelligence, Predicate Logic, Production Rules and agricultural analysis to identify Com Insect Pests and Diseases. With the use of E2gRule Writer and E2gRuleEngine, data of each case, with its corresponding selected bio-physical characteristics were converted into then rules and inputted into the logic block. The results of this research are very valuable to com growers, agriculture and forestry students and researchers. Agricultural farmers, students or any individual may use the practicable information of this expert system in ceder to gain more knowledge in managing the corn production.

TOWARDS ON THE DATA STRUCTURE OF UNIVERSITY COURSE SCHEDULING FOR PARALLEL COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT,"Prior to enrollment of each academic term, chairpersons and program coordinators of the Caraga State University prepares timetable of the schedules of all course offerings. Each schedule is plotted on the timetable of the three resources specifically the faculty resource, room resource and program block resource, all in sequential ceder, over the set of timeslots. However, if many schedule requests enter the queue, the total time required to accommodate all those will be significant. In this paper, the researcher presents a data structure for the University course schedule designed to manage multiple access to different rows of the resources to minimize the time required to manage the timetables. The design of the data structure includes a common structure for the three resources, an array to hold the list of each resource constraints, the set of operations needed to perform adding, deleting, updating and viewing of schedules on the timetable. A dispatcher method is designed to check resource constraints prior to executing the data structure's operations on insert, delete, update and view. The researcher presents the asymptotic behavior of the proposed navigations and operations of the structure.

"DESIGN, FABRICATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF COCOA SUGAR PROCESSING MACHINE","Production of coco sugar is still performed currently in a conventional method where more effort is exerted. This study was conducted to design and develop a coco sugar processing machine that could reduce human labor in a safer manner. The design of the machine comprised of three components namely: the evaporating component, granulating component and crushing component. Each component's capacities and over- all machine capacity were evaluated using three different volumes (1.5L, 2L, 3L) of coconut sap per feed. Performance evaluation showed that 3 liters of coconut sap gave the highest machine capacity at 156 g/hr with a corresponding crushing efficiency of 95.93%.

WEB-BASED REAL TIME BUS ROUTE TRACKING SYSTEM,"Public utility vehicles, like buses are the most accessible mode of transportation. However, information on the availability of buses on route bus terminal location, time of departures and arrivals so as current bus location is not vividly served to the riding public and therefore causes inconvenience. This research presented aims to build a Web-based Real Time Bus Route Tracking Application for the utility of both the passengers and bus personnel. This project provides reliable information through GIS (Geographic Information System) using Google Map APS, an application to display map that has sub modules to generate points, The system utilizes two faces of modem technology, first, a GPS (Global Position Satellite tracking system using android phone application that provides positional data and route information of target vehicles, specifically buses.Seconda Web-based Application for communication infrastructure that allows potential users to access information in real time. Furthermore the system requires internet connected gadgets such as an android phone with bus tracker application that would send its geographical information only after it had been directly connected to the web server. One can also utilize Personal Computer or Laptop for the passenger and bus peronnel to access the system.",webbased real time bus route tracking systempublic utility vehicle like bus accessible mode

CSU LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING RFID TECHNOLOGY,"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems became pervasive in our daily lives due to their low cost and easy to use characteristics. It was a new generation of Auto Identification and Data collection technology which automated library processes and allowed identifications of large number of tagged objects like books, using radio waves. Due to these facts, researchers enhanced the current library management system of Caraga State University which was inefficient and time consuming. The researchers came up to a predicament on how RFID technology be integrated for a more efficient and secured library management. By the use of RFID technology, transactions were quick and easy. The application of RFID tags/cards system as a library management system (LMS), enabled the library assets to be track in the library. were purposed to improve the library management systems. The RFID technology enabled the library assets to be tract in the library. The system used the components of RFID system, database management and web-based information system. When RFID tags/cards passed through RFID reader in a range zone, the system records the data captured from the RFID tags/cards to the database's system. The device's alarm will be activated and library personnel will be informed that someone made a violation. The study also provided a comprehensive route for an enhanced the CSU Library services, upgraded library efficiency and security and gave credit to the university's mission's which was, ""To produce graduates who are Scientifically trained, Technologically skilled and Morally upright"".

DATA ANALYTICS FOR RICE PEST DAMAGE IN CARAGA REGION: FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS REVOLUTION IN AGRICULTURE,"Rice is the staple food in the Philippines especially in Caraga Region. In Caraga Region, palay production at 462,182 metric tons and area harvested at 150,076 hectares but these productions are threatened by rice pests (PSA, 2016). On the other hand, data analytics is the process of scrutinizing data sets to obtain conclusions about the information they contain with the of specialized systems and softwares (Rouse, 2019). Currently in Caraga Region, there is no existing data analytics on how to determine the damage caused by rice pests and the parameters to be used in data analytics are still unknown. For this, Python language was used to design data analytics that determines the damage caused by rice pests and determines also the parameters needed to create data analytics. Data analytics for rice pest damage in Caraga Region is therefore vital in forecasting the possible rice damage by a specific rice pest. Further enhancements of this study will aid in efficient application of the right amount of pesticide thus lessening the chemical residues while protecting the rice crops and raising the productivity and the profit of farmers.

AN INVENTORY SYSTEM ON IDENTIFICATION OF CORE RURAL CONDITIONS IN BUTUAN CITY,"Roads are clearly a critical enabling condition for improving the living conditions in rural areas. However, the distribution of socioeconomic benefits resulting from a rural road is a separate issue, and there are no guarantees or inherent mechanisms to ensure that these benefits will be distributed equitably between the poor and the non-poor in the communities. In the rural road projects studied, their ability to affect the distribution of assets and the skills capacity of the poor was limited and largely outside their scope. Nevertheless, recognizing how assets are distributed is important both for understanding how benefits will accrue and for planning complementary measures to enable those who lack assets also to benefit from the investment. Given the right complementary activities, projects can broaden livelihood opportunities. The poor need support to make use of the opportunities that rural roads may bring. The Office of the City Engineer of Butuan City has been managing the roads condition and circumstances since, the researchers believe that a decision support system that is proficient of analyzing the roads condition and situation. With that the researchers developed an inventory of identification of core rural road condition that will assist the Office of City Engineer of Butuan City on their decision making regarding the reconstruction of the core rural roads in Butuan City.

SANITATION AND HYGIENE INSPECTION MAP OF FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS IN BUTUAN CITY,"Sanitation and hygiene practices play an important role in preserving good health amongst the public and their surrounding environment. The practice of good environmental sanitation helps prevent the occurrence of sanitation-related illnesses and the spread of diseases to ensure that a food establishment is compliant with the rules and regulations concerning the health of the public, a food establishment is required to secure a sanitary permit issued by the local health authority before obtaining a food business permit. This is in response to Chapter 3 Section 14-A in the Presidential Decree No. 856 Code of Sanitation stating that no food establishment for public patronage is allowed to operate without the acquisition of a sanitary permit from the local health authority. With the increasing number of food establishments in Butuan City, the local health authority struggles to identify the validity of each of the many food establishments with sanitary permits as no tool or medium is used to visualize raw data to assist in the monitoring and the coordination of inspections. The researchers have conducted an interview with the city health office of Butuan to identify the problems and current challenges they are facing. This government office is responsible for monitoring the sanitary permits of all food establishments in the city. The researchers develop an innovative solution through a web application that records and handles information about food establishment inspection and integrates an interactive map for displaying geographic data that provides greater efficiency in the process of generating reports and assessments. This paper is aimed at the development of a full-stack web application with Geographical Information System implementation to profile and locate food establishments with sanitary permits and their validity status. The application is tested and evaluated by the intended beneficiaries of this study and responded positively with additional features suggested.

"COMPUTER-BASED RECORD KEEPING AND MONITORING SYSTEM FOR THE OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS, SCHOLARSHIP, AND AIDS (OASA) AND STUDENT AFFAIRS AND SERVICES (OASA)","Selecting projects for development is crucial in some organization that could greatly influence the progress of an office. Office of Student Affairs and Services and the Office of Admission, Scholarship, and Aid are some of the offices in Caraga State University wherein its administration is centered on almost similar affairs. An undeniable task of these offices is both record keeping and monitoring of data. Existing mechanism in data handling is done manually which lead to several disadvantages. Some of the mentioned disadvantages are, uneconomical usage of papers and other data handling materials, inefficient data retrieval, and unorganized data storage due to space limitation. With this, a Computer-based Record Keeping and Monitoring System was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 to determine the condition of the eight (8) transactions of the office namely, the Violation, ID Validation, Complaint, Good Moral, Scholarship Tagging, the Incoming and Outgoing Communications. Using the Crystal Report, the system can generate reports for each office transactions. The system has been tested for its efficacy, sufficiency, and software environment and was considered to be a valuable asset for the office personnel.

A CLIENT-BASED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR MANAGING BARANGAY DUMALAGAN SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITION,"Selecting projects for the development of a barangay is a crucial decision in many barangay officials and socio-economic problems could greatly influence the progress of a barangay. Brgy. Dumalagan is one of the barangays in Butuan City wherein its administration undertakes the same state of affairs.

Decision Support Systems are stand-alone IT applications based on Database Management Systems and can be used to support the barangay Dumalagan's management to organize and plan for the specific projects that are anchored to the development of the said barangay. The system generates reports such as barangay clearance, barangay certificate, cedula, etc. The system has been tested for its efficacy, sufficiency and software environment and was considered to be a valuable asset for the barangay administration.

SIGN LANGUAGE DICTIONARY ON MOBILE ANDROID TECHNOLOGY,"Sign Language Dictionary on Mobile Android Technology is an offline application that helps normal hearing people understand people with disabilities more - especially the families who wish to learn the sign language for the sake of their deaf children without the costly fees and time consuming undertakings. Because of its portability and ease of use with step by step instruction of photos and videos on how to learn the common sign language gestures and its availability, this study was essentially significant for those who want to be involved in such learning. The application ran exclusively for android mobile phones, written in a Java using the Android Jellybean as its platform. In addition, the phone must be Java enabled and the screen size and resolution should be 720x1280 xhdpi. Accordingly, the researcher used the MicroSD memory storage since the application needs enough space available for videos and pictures. In terms of time processing, users do not need to wait longer for the response of the application. The application responded quickly to the user's needs either translating picture or video. Since the application is basic, future researchers can enhance the application and make its contents more fun and entertaining to the users in terms of adding more videos that can be more educative and using some innovative approaches to be easily understood and grasped by children.

USING FACEBOOK TO INVESTIGATE THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE OF AGUSAN DEL NORTE TO POWER OUTAGES,"Social media has evolved into a platform for businesses and consumers to communicate, resolve customer service issues, and gather feedback on what they want. It shows them whether a consumer's overall feelings were positive, negative, or neutral after engaging with the company at a certain point in their journey. The main goal of the research is to analyze the sentiment on the power company's Facebook page about power interruptions. This study intends to assess consumers' mental health during power outages and investigate community resiliency. Mental well-being is proved as a part of community resilience as well as the emotional aspect of a person. The concept has a three-phase model: data gathering, labeling and classifying, and conclusion for community resilience. Researchers used a Facepager to collect data accurately, which helped them meet the study's aims and methodology. The dataset was implemented using a sentiment analysis through the VADER-Lexicon approach that allows understanding of client sentiments for their time spent asking questions, resolving problems, and sharing positive and negative experiences can help a company develop. The study resulted in a positive community resilience that generated 39% of the positive sentiment results. Social media usage can provide a chance and assist in learning about the situation of homes during a power outage. It may give ideas to ANECO when they analyze consumers' feedback on their services.

ANDROID-BASED SOIL PH MONITORING OF VEGETABLE PRODUCING BARANGAY IN BUTUAN CITY,"Soil performs an important function in our environment. Furthermore, soils are variable, which means their capability to perform these important functions also differs and it plays an important role in determining land use. Especially farmers are dependent to the soil cultivating, plant it and use as a source of living This study aimed to monitor soil pH acidity and content with mapping capability and to recommend what kind or variety of vegetable is suitable in that specific area uning three (3) parameters soil pH, temperature and soil type. Android mobile use in farmers and vegetable growers is as the core components to more helpful to increase productivity of the vegetable. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the android based system was created and programmed Elipse Java or Javascript language, JSON Parsing and PHP that also integrates the Google API for mapping The results of this research are very valuable to vegetable growers, agriculture and soil laboratory sectors, students and researchers. Agricultural technologists, farmers, students or any individual may use the practicable information about the soil pH content and details order to gain knowledge and apply management to create better

FORECASTING SOIL PH AND VEGETABLE PRODUCING BARANGAY IN BUTUAN CITY,"Soil pH is one of the requirements, soil perform important function in our environment especially to the farmer, hence farmers have no idea in soil pH and vegetable suitability of their land given a specific period, soils are variable; in which means their capability to perform these important functions also varies, and it plays an important role in determining land use. Especially farmers are dependent to the soil cultivating, plant it and use as a source of living in which this study aimed to create automate system that manage soil pH in Butuan City Baranagays, With this, there were already available preliminary data in a relation to its parameter soil pH, temperature. The web based created and programmed Java Script language and PHP code generate a graph as a result. The result of this research are very valuable to vegetable growers, agriculture and soil laboratory sectors, students and other researchers as a guide for future study. Agricultural technologies, farmers, students or any any individual may use practicable information about soil pH content and valuable information regardless on the said study in order to gain knowledge and apply management to create better vegetable production.

ANDROID-BASED GARBAGE COLLECTION NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IN BUTUAN CITY,"Solid waste is a societal problem that we are facing today. The more people that are created the more garbage that are produced. The garbage that are not collected by the authorities results to air pollution, soil pollution and water pollution that dispose anywhere by the resident. Because of the act by the resident the authorities implement a legislative provision for the garbage collection, collection points are built and approved. With this act by the resident we came up with the solution that creating a mobile application that can report the garbage problem in the society is the best way to reduce the illegal dumping of garbage. Similarly, scheduling for garbage collection in every barangay of Butuan City, viewing of collection points that built by the barangay level through google maps monitoring. Also, a notification for the resident to be aware if the garbage collector is scheduled to collect their garbage. Some residents want to dispose their garbage that is not in scheduled time, this application has a feature to request a pickup garbage collector to dump their garbage.

C CODE IDENTITY CHECKER USING FLOWCHART SIMILARITY MEASUREMENT,"Source code plagiarism had immensely spreading nowadays. This aroused not just in the world of IT and over network but even in academic institutions. This work had developed a code identity checker as productivity tool of measuring similarity between copied and original C program codes. The code checker build is a combination of techniques that constituted a flowchart similarity measurement. It presented syntactic and semantic token-based approach, made flow-chart and statements' fingerprints and similarity computation that quantified the codes similarity measures. The checker was implemented on Borland Turbo C programming tool and made testing and analysis with students sample C source codes. Results confirmed that our method had effectively found reasonable similarity measures for code identity checking, The ideas of our work could also be incorporated in some existing checker or tools to efficiently give redefined similarity measurement. Keywords: Flowchart, Fingerprinting, Blueprinting.

CCIS PROGRAM RETENTION ANALYSIS,"Student retention has been an increasing concern for Higher Education Institutions. According to studies, a significant percentage of students' attrition have been observed worldwide across different programs. Students' grade failures are seen to be one of the crucial factors that lead to this high attrition rate. Several studies have conducted focusing on retention analysis by various HEIS. However, no same research was conducted at Caraga State University, specifically in the College of Computing and Information Sciences. Thus, this study was done to analyze the student retention rate in the three (3) programs under the college from 2007 to present using statistical analytical tools. Further, it sought to identify if the students from the program have failing grades that may lead to students' decision to shift or to drop from their respective program. Results show that for BS in Computer Science, there is an average retention rate of 88%, 81% for BS in Information Technology and 77% for BS in Information Systems. Among the subjects in the three (3) programs that causes the students' retention are Mathematics courses like Algebra and Trigonometry courses.

COMPUTER ASSISTED SYLLABI AND TOS MAKINGS ENVIRONMENT FOR HEI TEACHERS,"Syllabus making is made to provide students with information about the form and content of a course. It provides a view into the instructor's plans for content to be covered throughout the course, methods of learning anticipated, and schedule for accomplishing the different steps and learning tasks, culminating in a final exam or project. Several studies have shown that questions of content and conceptual understanding are troublesome in making an outcomes-based education aligned syllabus. This has resulted in the recognition that teachers require greater guidance and support in content specification. With this Computer Assisted Syllabi and TOS Making Environment for HEI Teachers, this aims to address the difficulties acquired on making an OBE aligned syllabus. The system assist instructors in making their OBE aligned syllabus and table of specification (TOS). The instructor input a topic and chose what cognitive domain category it belongs (Creating, Evaluating, Analyzing, Applying, Understanding and Remembering). The system will suggest appropriate verbs from the Blooms Taxonomy based on the topic inputted and category the instructor has selected. The system also automate the TOS making, the Instructor inputs the topics that will be given the desired hours rendered in the topic, percentage and points for its learning objectives based on the blooms taxonomy cognitive domain category and based on the inputted hours, points and percentage the system will automatically calculate the total hours, points and percentage. The system is web-base. It was being made using HTML5, Angularjs and Bootstrap as front-end and PHP5 and PostgreSQL as backend. The proposed system will be able to increase productivity, improve the efficiency of learning process and will significantly add to the effort in a massive curriculum development.

USING MAPPING SYSTEM FOR PROACTIVE CRIME MANAGEMENT AN REPORTING FOR BCPO,"Technology has played a major part of today's world. Development of various automated information systems are rampant because of its proven significance to different institutions. It is why proponents of this project have sought to answer the manual way of management and reporting crimes. This study came up with a web-based system for both police and general users, plus an android application for a more accessible reporting system. The purpose of this study is to receive reports from concerned citizens of Butuan City about crime incident that is happening within the vicinity. Thus, Butuan City Police Office can respond immediately. Crime being an act against the law of a society is a threat to the well- being of the populace and so, requires efficient and effective monitoring. This system have been developed to achieve this purpose. However, the BCPO uses a traditional way of managing and reporting crimes, which is, the use of pen and paper. This records are therefore susceptible to destruction from pests and uncensored manipulation by both authorized and unauthorized personnel. This crude method has resulted in problems in the areas of authenticity, security, retrieval, storage, and exchange of information within BCPO. In developing this system, the waterfall model of system development was adopted through the stages of requirement elicitation from stakeholders to the systems design and analysis using tools such as entity relationship diagram for the database, context diagram and data flow diagram which describe user and system requirements. The system was implemented using PHP for a highly interactive graphical user interface, and MySQL for a robust database. The system enhances efficiency in correcting the problems earlier stated and it is an effective tool for easy analysis of data which will improve the BCPO's law enforcement operations. The implementation of this system will result in lower crime rate within Butuan City.

A WEB-BASED GIS THREAT ANLYSIS AND PROFILING ON SELECTED SPECIES IN BAYUGAN III ROSARIO AGUSAN DEL SUR,"The absence of a system that will provide information and analyzed the area vulnerability in Bayugan III, Rosario Agusan Del Sur leads to a difficult way of identifying factors affecting the extension of endangered species. To fulfill in the said shortfall, this study demonstrated the development of a web based geographical information system threat analysis and profiling where three factors we've been used to analyze the vulnerable area where endangered species live which is identifying suitable habitat, human population based on land cover, and proximity buffer for mining sites. PHP was used for the whole processing and the Graphical User Interface (GUI) was utilized using the application of twitter bootstrap liquid templates. The GIS layers where displayed through Google Maps and Google Fusion Table as a map server. Furthermore, XAMP server was used for the local data storage. It was proved that the designed system worked with a very high effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy as evidence by the very high usability result when actual software testing was conducted. The develop GUI provide an easy fast access of the valuable information that can guide users on vulnerable issue.

CSU-CENTRAL STUDENT GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM,"The advances and continuing improvements in technology greatly affect running a successful organization. Hence, the evolution of technology played a vital role in developing this system. The Central Student Government of Caraga State University (CSU) practices the traditional and the slow process of managing the finances and giving information to the student. With this in mind, the authors propose that manual financial operation shall be transformed into a web-based financial management information system to provide more efficient and reliable service. The system will be called ""CSU- CSG Financial Management and Information System"". The student can surf the site freely and view related information without showing up to the Central Student Government office. The administrator will be the one who will have the right to access and manipulate financial transactions in the system. This proposal aims to discuss thoroughly all the steps and processes involved in the implementation of CSU-Central Student Government Financial Management and Information System. Finally, this research goes to prove the much easier accessibility and less burdensome job in tracking and retrieving transaction records without sacrificing the integrity of the organization's data.",csucentral student government financial management information systemthe advance continuing improvement technology greatly affect running successful organization hence evolution technology

PROVINCIAL HOSPITAL PATIENT INFORMATION SYSTEM,"The Agusan del Norte Provincial Hospital plays an important role in the delivery of basic health services for the people of Butuan City and even the constituents of the CARAGA Region. In the delivery of services, time and accuracy are essential for efficient service to the public. The Provincial Hospital is presently seeking ways meet these challenges to better serve the citizenry. With this in mind, the hospital administration has endeavored to create and maintain systematic way of filling and retrieving files. However, the hospital continues to encounter some difficulties in processing reports and patients' record since the process is done in multiple step to come up with accurately organized files. A computer based Provincial Hospital Patient Information System would help solve this problem. In this system, it is easier for the personnel to add, modify/update, delete and view patient information. This proposed system is very functional as it can store, generate and also retrieve files and data automatically. This study includes a system analysis of the existing system, as well as that of the proposed system.",provincial hospital patient information systemthe agusan del norte provincial hospital play

REAL-TIME TRAFFIC MONITORING AND VISUALIZATION USING Stationary ROADSIDE SENSOR IN A ROAD INTERSECTION,"The aim of this study is to develop a web-based system that would visualize Realtime traffic by deploying lightweight monitoring devices in roadside intersections in the vicinity of Butuan City to help commuters and drivers produce an optimized decision in utilizing efficient roadways for traveling. This study will also account for the local government of Butuan City in building a better traffic management systemwide for policymakers and academics to identify the disadvantages of traffic congestion. Using loT, wireless communication devices, and Artificial Intelligence (Al), we've identified that traffic congestion occurs in intersections where it is commonly used by PUJs, PUVs, and public transport vehicles. The significance of this study is that it provides meaningful information to convey relevant information for real-time vehicle monitoring. . This helps drivers, passengers, traffic and transportation offices, and organizations to gain traffic information for optimal decision-making such as choosing the fastest route and increasing productivity and services. This would also aid in identifying certain problems and generating coherent solutions regarding transportation or traffic issues.

IOT FOR SMART AIRCONDITION MONITORING,"The air-conditioning unit has been widely used in many parts of the world to provide comfort and acceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) for the occupants. Nowadays, monitoring of equipment in some agencies are still currently done manually through checking the specific device personally. In some cases, users of the air-conditioning unit are also unaware of the condition and wait until such time that it would not function before calling the attention of the general services unit, which leads to the fast degradation of the unit and inconvenience in the working place. This study develops an lot for Smart Air- condition Monitoring the status of the equipment based on the vibration, temperature and humidity of the unit. To identify the vibration, temperature and humidity of the unit, this study uses vibration sensor, temperature and humidity sensor were connected to the equipment and send the sensed data to the Raspberry Pi server to monitor its status based on the sensor readings. The classification efficiency of the system was conducted, thus, the system was able to provide high accuracy during the classification process from 217 data a total of 211 data were correctly classified obtaining an average of 97.24% accuracy. The researcher concludes that the system could monitor the status of the air-conditioning unit based on the data that had been gathered from different sensors.

AUTOMATED COURSE CREDIT FOR CSU PROGRAMS,"The Automated Course Credit for CSU Programs was developed using web technologies integrated to web server. The system is user-friendly using Twitter Bootstrap that is supported by HTML, CSS and Javascript. The Web-Based System was designed and developed by the researchers that will serve as a tool to be used by the Caraga State University students for their own self-evaluation of their current standing and will automatically generate and display subjects that can possibly be credited to other degree programs as well as the total number of semesters for completion, which is based on the data the student entered using their computers and laptops. This system can also automatically generate and display subjects that can be credited in each course, and also the possible subjects that can be substituted if the student tends to shift to other degree programs with the approval of the chairperson. This system is more efficient to the students, chairperson and the registrar's office.

WEB BASED MAPPING ON SPECIES DISTRIBUTION OF CSU HERBARIUM,"The collection of the preserved plant specimen (herbarium) by the Researchers can provide a detailed record of the interesting people, it is the basis of identifying the existing plants in the area and a detailed record of historical change. As the main goal of this research, the researchers create a dynamic database and distribution mapping of the specimen. By the use of the technique of of some tools of Google fusion table in which has the ability to upload data tables from spreadsheet, CSV files or KML files supported by GIS. The technique of Google ft has the ability to produce HTML codes and scripting the codes through JAVA into the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the web based system. It was made and programmed in PHP and the database is made through mySQL.. It can give the adaptable information to the researchers and permit to the natural botanical researchers and environmental studies in Caraga State University to store and share their research to

WEB-BASED MAPPING ON SPECIE DISTRIBUTION OF CSU HERBARIUM,"The collection of the preserved plant specimen (herbarium) by the Researchers can provide a detailed record of the interesting people; it is the basis of identifying the existing plants in the area and a detailed record of historical change. As the main goal of this research, the researchers create a dynamic database and distribution mapping of the specimen. By the use of the technique of some tools of Google fusion table in which has the ability to upload data tables from spreadsheet, CSV files or KML files supported by GIS. The technique of Google ft has the ability to produce HTML codes and scripting the codes through JAVA into the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the web based system. It was made and programmed in PHP and the database is made through mySQL. It can give the adaptable information to the researchers and permit to the natural botanical researchers and environmental studies in Caraga State University to store and share their research to others.

DEVELOPMENT OF SMART TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROLLER THROUGH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"The common way to manage road intersection traffic is done through traffic lights. Existing traffic light intersection controllers have a fixed timing in their outputs without considering the real-time traffic situation. This study aims to develop a smart traffic light controller which is adaptive depending on the traffic situation in order lessen the traffic in intersections. In order to achieve the smart traffic light controller, reinforcement learning is the technique in which the researchers implement for its development. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique that best fits this problem. It learns by interacting through its environment and given rewards and punishment based on its actions. In this paper, the researchers used two RL methods namely Deep Q- Learning/Network (DQN) and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary-Strategies (CMA-ES) with the same deep neural network architecture to implement the smart traffic light controller and will be simulated via Unity 3D. The smart traffic light agent is tested in two test areas with easy and hard levels of traffic with DQN, CMA-ES together with the Fixed-Time for its basis. The results of this study demonstrate the advantage of using RL over fixed time traffic controller, and yet exhibit different outcomes depending on the different traffic dynamics being considered. The researchers found out that CMA-ES had better performance for a smart traffic light controller.

ESTIMATING ROCK MASS STRENGTH AT MANILA MINING CORPORATION USING HOCK-BROWN FAILURE CRITERION,"The constants relating stresses and strains within the rock mass are important aspects that should be determine in promoting a safety in the workplace for open pit mines. Thus, this study aimed to properly estimate the rock mass strength using the Generalized Hock- Brown Failure Criterion and its equivalent Mohr- Coulomb Criterion. A total of eight (8) andesite core samples were obtained at MSS-1 (undisturbed rock mass) and RV 17-16 (disturbed rock mass) of Manila Mining Corporation. There are four (4) samples each location, two (2) of which were kept dry, one (1) was submerged in the water for six(6) hours and the other one (1) was submerged in the water for twelve (12) hours. The samples were tested for its uniaxial compressive strength. Results revealed that at the range of 72Mpa-81Mpa and 36Mpa-39Mpa dry samples from MSS-1 and RV 07-16 fail respectively. For the wet samples, the strength of rock mass decreases by average of 33% and 43% for samples soaked for (6) hours and twelve. The expected effect of soaking with water was evident thus this criterion can provide not just an estimate of rock mass strength but also other strength parameters.

CSU DORMITORY ACCOMODATION INFORMATION SYSTEM,"The continual advance of technological progress today has brought us to higher places that we have not dreamed of. One of those advances is in the use of computers. It has made life easier and made many things possible. Web-based system application is one of this, which takes place in the business world in many different ways. This software project entitled, ""CSU Dormitory Accommodation Information System"", aims to create efficient transactions through computerized information system that can provide better service and efficiently handle the students, employees and the staff of the dormitory operations are carried out manually which eventually results to a slow process of transaction, unreliable information and inefficient services. For these reasons, the manual system would be created into a computer-based information system since the computer can provide more efficient and reliable service. dormitory operations. Through this project, the dormitory employees allow them to easily manage the said dormitory operations. Furthermore, data processing, updating records, searching, retrieving and managing will be faster and convenient which will pave the way to a better quality of services in the university.",csu

DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SUPPLY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,"The current flow of system in use at the Supply Office of NORMISIST is a manual based, from requisitioning of materials/supplies process up to process of withdrawal until to the inventory process. The office also has a problem in their repository of data's that hassle the personnel in times of retrieving/scanning when it is needed, example of it is the inventory process it needed the previous transaction that the office made. This current flow has slowly becoming obsolete. The researchers conducted a study on the NORMISIST Supply Office, from requisitioning process up to the inventory process. This research conducted on the month of December 2003. This Thesis Project developed through series of interviews, data gathering and fact finding on order to have a complete grasp with their system and the research study is entitled as ""Design and Implementation of Supply Management System"". The purpose of the proposed project is to have a computerized preparation of papers/forms needed in all of the transaction of the office from requisitioning up to the inventory processes. With the user identification and its corresponding passwords, personnel user will just use the developed system. All the details of transactions will be stored in the database. Data are safe with the prepared repository because of the log-in security of the program.",design implementation supply management systemthe current flow system use supply office normisist manual

AGGREGATION OF NON-SYNDICATED CONTENT IN A DISTRIBUTED ENVIRONMENT,"The huge amount of information in the web was the driving motivation to syndicate content over the internet. Syndication specification emerged such as RSS 0.9, 1.0 and 2.0 to standardize the aggregation of content. However, even with the advent of RSS technology, there are websites that don't have syndication mechanism because of some underlying technical reason. This study focused on aggregation of non- syndicated content using container-based approach. An experimental investigation of non-syndicated website was employed to check and validate content containers. The container structure is analyzed to develop an algorithm for container identity extraction. The proof of concept is implemented using XPATH and Jquery.",aggregation nonsyndicated content distributed environmentthe huge amount information web driving motivation syndicate content internet

NORMISIST AUTOMATED LEAVE ACCRUAL SYSTEM,"The Human Resource Management Office (HRMO) is the sole entity of the institution which is accountable for the calculation of employees or staffs leave accrual. To date, the office is using manual method in calculating employees or staffs leave accrual. It is a tedious work of computation and data manipulation. Since the current system is manually done, then it is very much prone to human errors, and that the data manipulation such as the storing and retrieving of files would surely entails more time for it is done in a paper-based manner. As it is, analyzing a set of resources to come up with a non- conflicting data is not an easy thing to do. The researchers conducted a sequence of interviews, data gathering and fact finding in order to attain a good understanding with regards to the study. To resolve those problems, the researchers developed the web-based and automated system entitled ""NORMISIST Automated Leave Accrual System (NALAS)"", functions. to generate a computer-based means of calculating leave accrual and other leave related functions. It is essential in the institution since it is quicker than that of the currently used Manual Leave Accrual System. It's aim is to totally, if not minimize human errors in calculating employees or staffs leave accrual and other leave related functions which manipulating data. would insure fewer work and would entail less time in relaying reports and in manipulating data.",normisist automated leave accrual systemthe human resource management office hrmo sole entity institution accountable calculation

A DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM ON A WEB-BASED REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT INDICATOR (RDI) IN CARAGA REGION,"The lack of a centralized system that captured and analyzed development indicator data in Caraga region leads to a difficult way of measuring and identifying the degree of its progress. To fill in the said deficit, this study illustrated the development of a web-based decision support system that provided a model which forecasted future values across different Regional Development Indicators for control purposes that used Time Series Analysis via Box and Jenkins Univariate method. Codeigniter Php Framework was used for overall processing while visualizations like charts and maps were presented through Google Fusion Table and Highchart applications. Moreover, WAMP server was used for data storage and application for twitter bootstrap liquid template was utilized for graphical user interface of the system. It was observed that the designed system functioned with a very high effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy as evidenced by the very high usability result when actual software testing was conducted.

WEB-BASED GIS PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR PROVINCE OF AGUSAN DEL NORTE,"The main objective of the system is to use open source software and tools which can inform the public about road information such as road condition; the cost, duration, location of on-going construction and maintenance activities in different areas of Agusan del Norte. The researchers conducted a software presentation particularly to the travelers. After the presentation a questionnaire had been given to them to assess the software in terms of three (3) aspects: [1] Usefulness [2] Satisfaction and [3] Efficiency. These 3 were analyze and taken the weighted mean in order to view the perception of the user to the system and its data. There were fifty (50) respondents in the software presentation. The overall result which is the Grand Mean is equal 3.65 (Strongly Agree). For further improvement of the system it is also more understandable for every viewer if the map will show pictures of the roads of a certain place and it is also essential to plot other road sections for the future researchers in order to complete the Pavement Management System for Province of Agusan del Norte.

CUSTOMER ADVISOR ON ONE TOWN ONE PRODUCT (OTOP) PRODUCTS IN CARAGA,"The major source of livelihood and income in CARAGA is from production and reproduction and selling of agricultural products in the market. From the buyer's perspective, searching for a preferred product is time consuming since you would normally ask to the sales person and have to spend more and more time to know about the products and to survey the relevant product information for further comparison. On the other hand, the vendors or sellers display their products in the market and apart from that they used to promote their products by way of T.V. Ads, Radio, Newspapers and etc., in which the target market is only limit within the local area. This is a manifestation of an old-fashioned way of advertising product in the public.	Concerning the problem above, CARAGA obviously needed to establish a Customer Advisor that facilitate comparing and selecting products in the context of e- markets. An advisor that would recommend to a certain customer in choosing the appropriate products based on variety name, price range and location to where product can be found.",customer advisor one town one

CSU LIBRARY BOOK CLASSIFICATION USING DATA MINING,"The manual classification of book class number in CSU Library uses the Dewey Decimal Classification. The intention of this study is somehow, to automate the process of classifying book class number. The process involves the use of Knowledge Discovery in Databases which is composed of five steps: selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining and interpretation, as for this study the focus was on the core step of the whole procedure which is Data Mining. Data Mining was used due to the absence of rules to automatically classify books. The book titles were preprocessed resulting to a tokenized data which was implemented in Microsoft Visual Basic Environment and stored to POSTGRESQL 8.2 database server. After preprocessing, the data were transformed using POSTGRESQL crosstab function, and then data mining took place. In the Data Mining phase, Rosetta Software a Rough Set Toolkit was used to generate rules. After the data had undergone preprocessing and transformation it was fed in to Rosetta Software, creating a structured form containing a data set which is split into 70% training set and 30% test set which was applied to all experiments. The formulated rules were then implemented to Prolog Programming Language. This work also uses Microsoft Visual Basic, for the Graphical User Interface, which enables the user to interact with the systems.",csu library book classification using data miningthe manual

ACADEMIC PORTFOLIO: A WEB APPLICATION FRAMEWORK FOR AGGREGATING HEIs PROFILE,"The National Office of Commission on Higher Education (CHED) requires Higher Education Institutions (HEI) to submit their profile and other pertinent documents for normative financing through the CHED Regional Office. The data gathering is extremely work intensive and time consuming because of manual conversion to the specified format from CHED. This research is designed to facilitate the gathering and submission of documents to CHED by introducing a data exchange format called Academic Profile (AP) to fast track the collection of information from HEIs. The AP is designed based on XML, and accessible using RESTful services in the Internet. This XML format bridge the gap between the legacy system and the reporting requirement of other institution by providing a common data structure which can manipulated by different system. A web application framework is also introduced to demonstrate the concept of aggregation of HEls profile from different geographical location.

A DESIGN ON DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM ON MORBIDITY RATE ONN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN CARAGA REGION,"The need of an automated system that caters and analyze the transaction process and morbidity rate data of Department of Health in Caraga Region that leads to tricky measurement of analysis and identifying the data in the region, in each province and most especially in each hospital in the community. To note all hospitals are manually operated, this study illustrates the creation of a design in decision support system on morbidity rate on Department of Health in Caraga Region. This system provides a fast processing of data, computation of morbidity rate in each sickness in each hospital, provinces, and region. In this study we use Cloud Computing and Google Fusion Table for the data access, graphs, tables, and maps of each province. The system functions effectively fast, and efficiently. With the use of the software that are in the system accessing and analyzing data on morbidity rate as well as creating a decision for the stability of the hospital and medication need and facilities are all in.

AN INTELLIGENT VISION-BASED APPROAVH FOR MOTORCYLIST HELMET DETECTION USING YOLO-V5,"The on-going motorization of traffic has resulted in a steady rise in the number of road-related deaths and injuries worldwide, Governments are working on ensuring safe and law-abiding traffic conduct to combat this. However, there is a deficiency of comprehensive data on the safety-critical behavioral metric of motorcycle helmet wear, particularly in developing countries like the Philippines where motorcycles are the primary mode of transportation. Due to a lack of data, focused enforcement and education initiatives, which are critical for injury prevention, are not possible. As a result, we used the Yolovs technique to construct an algorithm for the automatic registration of motorcycle helmet wear from video data. Based on 5,008 annotated frames of video data, collected at the Caraga State University overpass, we trained our algorithm to detect helmeted and unhelmet motorcycle riders, as well as count them after passing the green line (serves as the counting tool). An analysis of the algorithmâs accuracy on an annotated test data set, and a comparison to available human-registered helmet use data reveal a high accuracy of our approach. Our algorithm registers helmeted and unhelmet rider use rates with helmet detection was met with high accuracy, ranging from 77.1% to 85.7%, while the motorcycle with no helmet had an accuracy of 62.3% to 84.7% compared to a human observer. The higher the datasets gathered and with a proper annotation the higher the accuracy it gets.",intelligent visionbased approavh motorcylist helmet detection using yolov5the ongoing motorization

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A STATIONARY PEST INFESTATION MONITORING DEVICE FOR RICE INSECT PESTS USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND RASPBERRY PI,"The overall purpose of this study is to design and develop a model that can detect and classify adult flying-stage insects for monitoring purposes using Convolutional Neural Network and Raspberry Pi, since the main problem of the study includes the decrease of the rice production cause by destructive pest in the rice plants and lack of monitoring device that can automatically detect and classify pest. Specifically, it also seeks solutions to the farmer's core problems such as farmers are still using traditional monitoring and counting system for rice plants in terms of destructive pest intruders, there is no existing monitoring device especially here in Butuan City that can detect and classify insect's pest automatically and the Stationary Pest Infestation using Convolutional Neural Network and Raspberry Pi is not yet tested. The other intention of this study is somehow, to automate the process of insect pests monitoring. The process involves data acquisition, labelling, training, trained CNN model, object detection and classification until the last part which is stored data in JSON format. It is being concluded, that by using raspberry pi for data gathering is good despite of its credit card-sized and small RAM capacity, it still performs well in detecting and classifying insects in real time scenario. Furthermore, there is a difficulty in the tensorflow version and installing libraries because of the updated tensorflow version, the researchers need to install the old version of tensorflow in This study has shown that using SSD_Mobilenet_Ver1_coco_2017_11_17 model, has performed well on initial tests in detection and classification of rice adult-flying insects.

LOCATION BROADCASTING USING MOBILE PUSH TECHNOLOGY,"The pace of change brought by new technologies has had a significant effect on the way people live, work and even play worldwide. New and emerging technologies such as mobile devices now has becoming part of the daily routine of every human being as their aid or even assistant in whatever things they wish they would do. In a progressing country like Philippines, most likely in one of its highly-urbanized city, Butuan, commuters always have uncertainties on their travel especially the buses. In the daily operation of public transport systems, mainly of buses, the movement of vehicles is affected by different uncertain conditions as the day progresses, such as traffic, congestion, unexpected delays, and randomness in passenger demand, irregular vehicle-dispatching times, and incidents. Location Broadcasting using Mobile Push Technology Mobile Application uses a variety of technologies to track the location of buses at a certain point or station and uses this information to commuters for possible predictions of bus arrivals, route schedule and status of the bus, making time efficient for the riding public to reach the bus stop just before the bus arrives or take an alternate means of transport if the bus is delayed. When properly and appropriately implemented, this can provide competitive enhancement to any transport companies and greater benefits for the community which in turn reduces traffic and pollution.

"DESIGN, FABRICATION AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF SAGO (METROXYLON SAGU ROTTB.) STARCH EXTRACTOR","The Philippines has now the potential of sago palm but up to present time's sago starch production and utilization were very low compared to its potential. The users were dependent to traditional method of extraction in which very inefficient and time consuming. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance capacity of the mechanical sago starch extractor. Generally, it aimed to design, fabricate and evaluate the performance focusing on the effect of the application of different ratios of water added in the pith to separate the starch. The extractor had a mixing and auger blades for easier extraction. There were tree (3) treatments examined in the experiment such as 5 kg of rasped pith and 5 L of water, 5 kg of rasped pith and 10 L of water; and 5 kg of rasped pith and 15 L of water using the same speed at 323 rpm. The performance evaluation was laid out by measuring the input capacity, starch recovery, extraction rate, losses and recovery, potential starch content and extraction efficiency. Result showed that the more the water added in the rasped sago pith the highest starch recovered. It was found out that the starch recovered was 32.1 % of 5 kg rasped pith of 15 liters of water thus resulted to 160.72 kg/day starch yield. Moreover, the efficiency of the machine was determined and it was found out that treatment 3 in trial 3 had the highest extraction efficiency of 96.3%. Using Analysis of Variance, RCBD, the level of significance was determined. It was found out that there is highly significant differences among treatments. Hence, the Sago Starch Extractor is recommended to use for small to medium scale processing specially to those who practice the manual extraction in remote areas.

AN AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION FOR INSECT PEST AND DISEASES FOR HIGH VALUE VEGETABLES,"The purpose of agriculture was to move the ecological balance of nature in favor of people related to other species and to meet the demand for agricultural products, especially food. In order to remain competitive, the modern farmer often relies on agricultural specialists and advisors to provide information for decision-making. This stody contains identification of insect pest and diseases for high value vegetables by using a knowledge-base expert system, involving production rules. An expert system normally composed of a knowledge based (information), inference engine (analyzes knowledge base), and end user interface (accepting inputs, generating outputs). The factors to consider the result of identifying insect pest and diseases are organism type, affected vegetable part, causes, insect stage, insect characteristics, symptom, damage and signs. This research was very valuable an aid to the farmers, agriculturist, students and any person who want to used the system in order to diagnose the vegetable insect pest and diseases and for decision-making in suggesting suitable recommendations. The researchers use the Expertise2go for generating rules and Joomla 1.5 as the GUI.

FACE IMAGE PREPROCESSING USING AFFINE TRANSFORMATION AND CONVEX HULL ALGORITHM,"The purpose of the study is to remove the unnecessary features in extracting the image data. The entire face image preprocessing is divided into two modules: face detection and preprocessing. CNN Based Face Detection algorithm is used to detect the face in the image, and Facial Landmark Detection algorithm to locate the facial points of the face. The study trained a model for detecting eight facial points using iBug 300W data set which consists of four major datasets: afw, helen, ibug, and Ifpw with the total numbers of 7238 images. Another training was conducted using CCIS Faculty datasets with the total numbers of 1240 images. The purpose of the training in different datasets is to test the accuracy and which model is efficient. The preprocessing technique called Affine Transformation algorithm is used to align the face after detecting the face in the image and convex hull algorithm is applied to create an elliptical mask of the face. After the Affine Transformation algorithm applied to the image, the image would be converted into grayscale and this grayscale image would be remapped for creating an elliptical mask with the used of Convex Hull algorithm. Results on the real-time indicate that the proposed algorithm can accurately preprocess the image. Furthermore, the trained model of detecting facial points are more accurate if the large data set is used. Moreover, the algorithm is tested on a real-time camera with different environmental conditions.

OBJECT SEARCH IN INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS USING DRONE THROUGH DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,"The rapid advancement of drone technology has opened up new possibilities for various applications, including object search and retrieval in indoor environments. In this study, we propose a novel approach for object search in indoor environments using a drone equipped with deep reinforcement learning. The objective of this research is to develop an intelligent system that allows a drone to autonomously navigate through complex indoor spaces and locate specific objects of interest. To achieve this, we employ a deep reinforcement learning framework and lidar technology, which enables the drone to learn optimal policies for navigation and object search through trial-and-error interactions with the environment. This study aims to compare and maximize three different popular reinforcement learning algorithms that support discrete actions, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Deep Q Network (DQN), and investigate the learning process for each algorithm assigned with both positive and negative rewards. Tested and evaluated in four indoor environments, each agent is trained for a specific number of timesteps set in every environment. These selected algorithms showed a significant difference in environment exploration and object search task capability. A2C executes high performance in object detection task, and PPO showed superior capability in handling complex observations. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of intelligent drones to autonomously navigate and search for specific objects, paving the way for applications in areas such as search and rescue operations, inventory management, and surveillance tasks in indoor settings.

WEB-BASED RECORD SYSTEM FOR NORMISIST SCIENCE LABORATORY,"The researcher conducted a study on the Science Laboratory of Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology (NORMISIST) especially in keeping the records. This software project was conducted through a series of interviews, and data gathering in order to have a complete knowledge on the existing system. The existing record system of NORMISIST Science Laboratory is manual-based in terms of keeping the record-keeping process. Problems encountered in using the manual method include slow retrieval and processing of data, no database handler, and slow process of tracking of materials, equipments and apparatuses. This study shall, therefore transform the manual-based into a web-based system. The recommended system will give safer repository of records maintaining accuracy and reliability, fast retrieval of files from the data storage, a good database handler and faster process of tracking of materials, equipments and apparatuses. It is beneficial to the in-charge personnel as it is effective and efficient. Services are catered faster as it makes searching, retrieval and updating of records, facilitating transaction, much easier.",webbased record system normisist science laboratorythe researcher

ONLINE DOCUMENT MONITORING WITH TRACKING SYSTEM,"The researcher identifies the main problem of the current system of NORMISIST for their monitoring of documents status that can make them burden in terms of monitoring and tracking the documents, which will be delaying the process of transaction, negligence of documents remains untraceable, inconsistency of data records of logbooks, and inefficiency retrieving of files from the archive. As determining the problems the researcher proposed an Online Document Monitoring with Tracking System to solve and provide the database storage of documents for fast retrieval of files, to provide a tracking system for the processing of documents, to create centralized logbook for easy tracking of the lost document, to determine the time span of the transacting documents in process.",online

SALES INVENTORY SYSTEM OF NORMISIST DIARY PROCESSING CENTER,"The researchers conducted a study on the NORMISIST Dairy Processing Center specifically in their method of sales inventory. This project was conducted during the month of November 2007 and ended on March 2008. The researchers conducted a series of interviews, data gathering and fact finding in order to have complete information with their system. The NORMISIST Dairy Processing Center Sales Inventory System's main activity is the sales inventory. However, most of the operation of this activity was carried out manually which eventually resulted to a slow process of transaction. A thorough study of the current system in sales inventory, monitoring and controlling of products as well as the determination of its expired/expiring products, the current system of the Dairy Processing Center will be superseded with a web-based system application in inventorying sales. With this proposed system, the staff of Dairy Processing Center will automatically input the data to the software application instead of the manual process. It can minimize time and avoid errors in inputting the data. The data is then safer because it is stored in an electronic database.",sale inventory system normisist diary processing centerthe researcher conducted study normisist dairy processing center

ANDROID APPLICATION: TRANSIT GUIDE FOR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC VEHICLES IN BUTUAN CITY,"The researchers develop a Transit Guide Android Application for Public and Private Vehicles in Butuan City that will provide transportation information to its users. Transit Guide application was designed and developed for Android supportive mobile devices in Eclipse IDE using the Java programming language. The initial requirement for this application is gathered through an interview in different agencies such as DOT, LTO and DPWH, and is followed by analysing features of existing similar applications. The results of this thesis are: (1) an Android application, which helps users find their destination, and (2) provide accurate transportation information for their entire trip. Based on the evaluation results, it can be concluded that the Transit Guide Android Application is useful for users to find public and private transportation route information.

DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION USING K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR ALGORITHM: A RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR ACCREDITATION,"The study focuses on enhancing the records management system of CCIS accreditation. The researchers utilized the PyTesseract OCR and PyPDF2 Library for text extractions, as well as the KNN algorithm for automatic classification and tagging of AACCUP documents. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Pytesseract OCR and document classification using the KNN algorithm with TFIDF vectorization. Preprocessing techniques and training with multiple fonts and characters significantly improved text extraction accuracy. However, challenges persisted with certain fonts, styles, and backgrounds. Although KNN successfully predicted specific tags, it encountered memory usage issues, necessitating further improvements for enhanced performance in other areas. Incorporating multiplemethods for document classification is necessary to achieve optimal tagging in big data. In conclusion, the integration of Pytesseract OCR, preprocessing techniques, and the KNN algorithm with TFIDF vectorization substantially improves the existing record management system for accreditation in CCIS.

TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION OF SEARCHING PRODUCT INFORMATION USING OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION OF ANDROID TECHNOLOGY,"The study generally aims to design and develop a system that performs searching of product information using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). We used the method of product image enhancement techniques in recognizing product information. The researchers have conducted an experiment to determine the capability of the system to recognize text using mobile application. Providing each distant measurement of the mobile phone camera from the test subjects, the researchers were able to record significant results in the realization of this study. The researchers also used Google Text API (GTA) for converting incorrect text recognition applying the Searching Algorithm. With the functionalities of OCR and GTA, the image recognition processes the accuracy of detecting and recognizing of captured image and converted to Text is slightly high. However, its accuracy for the reason that it depends on the lighting, distance of the mobile camera from the test subjects and mobile phone specifications.

COMPUTER-AIDED ENROLMENT SCHEDULING SYSTEM,"The study of Computer-Aided Enrolment Scheduling System was designed to come up with an efficient and accurate class scheduler to be used in Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology. The researchers set the resources such as the subject, faculty, room, and time as the primary schedule. base information needed in creating the schedules. These resources have been scheduled properly, meeting certain conditions in order to have a desired class schedule. These conditions are; a.) The slot for that specified schedule is not yet occupied and does not violate any other assignments. This assures that duplication of schedules will be headed off. b.) All the resources being scheduled are free from conflicts and have not been used for other allocation. As for the instance of time allocation, half hour conflicts could be avoided. c.) The use of the resources for each class schedule is free from any restrictions. The scheduler was made through MySQL, a relational database used as a device in accessing, adding, and organizing the data in order to meet the prescribed schedule. MS Visual Basic is the programming language used. In addition, ODBC was used to connect the databases. The idea of Client/Server and networking was also applied. It also allows the method of drag and dropping in making schedules for faculty, subject and class. It was found out that through the use of all these tools and ideas, accurate and efficient schedule is possible. And that it meet its objectives to have an improved and alternative approach in making schedules which assist the administrator in designating the room, time, faculty, and subject. Enrolment process could be better performed through the scheduler.",computeraided enrolment scheduling systemthe study computeraided enrolment scheduling system designed come efficient accurate class

WATER QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF CABADBARAN WATERSHED,"The study was conducted to assess the water quality in Cabadbaran Watershed particularly in Brgy. Mahaba since the residence in the said Barangay and the people in Cabadbaran City were not privy as to the latest situation or level of their potable water which was their main source of water supply for drinking Hence, this study aims to collect secondary data such as existing water quality and land use classification. The researchers went to Forest Land Use Planning City ENRO, Cabadbaran City, and DENR-EMB Caraga where they gathered the data Laboratory analysis of water samples from the catchment basin in Brgy. Mahaba streams with three (3) sampling stations in the same source as streams was also conducted. Every sampling station contains four (4) samples, which have two (2) samples for physical and chemical parameters and two (2) samples for bacteriological parameters then placed it in cooler and submitted to Butuan City Water District (BCWD) were based from Philippine National Standard for Drinking Water (PNSDW) and Water Quality Criteria (DAO 34) Result showed for physical and chemical analysis to have good potable water in every sampling station, but for bacteriological analysis it was interpreted to have unsecured level of potable water because of the exceeding quantity of bacteria in the water samples namely: total coliform. fecal coliform and heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria which do not meet the maximum criteria for patable water in every sampling station. In general, Brgy. Cabadbaran Watershed was at a critical level of their drinking water. Finally, the researchers produced a map of water quality assessment of Cabadbaran Watershed.",water quality assessment cabadbaran watershedthe study conducted ass water quality cabadbaran watershed

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF SEMI-AUTOMATED CAUSTIC SODA SOLUTION FEEDER FOR THE WATER TREATMENT POND OF PHILSAGA MINING CORPORATION IN BUNAWAN AGUSAN DEL NORTE,"The study was conducted to develop a Caustic Soda Flakes Solution Feeder used in neutralizing the pH of the acidic water coming from the underground mining operations of Philsaga Mining Corporation that has the ability to change its feed rate with respect to the changing volumetric flowrate of acidic water. The fabricated Caustic Soda Flakes Solution Feeder is comprised mainly of the main assembly and the feeding assembly. The main assembly is composed of the Caustic Soda Flakes solution Tank and its stand which serves as the support of the instrument. The feeding assembly is composed of the paddle connected to the faucet and the valve in which its pull is controlled by the attached spring. The concept is the larger the volumetric flowrate of acidic water, the greater the pull of the paddle to the valve and the other way around, thus providing a means to control the feed rate with respect to the volumetric flowrate of acidic water. The spring and the connection of the valve to the paddle is installed in a way that they can be adjusted/ calibrated depending on the volumetric flowrate of acidic water. The Caustic Soda Flakes Solution Feeder was tested at the NIA irrigation canal at the back of Caraga State University whose volumetric flow rate was at the time of testing was 30832.07 cm3/s almost the same as the volumetric flow rate of the acid mine is cm3/s. drainage 31744.39 Philsaga Mining Corporation which at The maximum feed rate obtained was 66.77 mL/s and have been tested to decrease its feed rate when the flow of water in the canal was altered. The depth of the paddle, tension in the spring and the ball valve above the discharge was installed in a way that it can be calibrated easily to get the desired specific feed rate with respect to volumetric flow rate.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED LOCATION IF SUITABLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF SILANGAN MINDANAO MINING COMPANY INCORPORATION TAILINGS STORAGE FACILITY,"The study was conducted to evaluate the proposed location of the Tailings Storage Facility of Silangan Mindanao Mining Company Incorporation (SMMCI). Site screening criteria considers locating the embankment downhill near the processing site to allow gravity flow of tailings and availability of construction materials within the vicinity of the project. In siting the suitability of the proposed location, various parameters are being evaluated. This consists geological setting: topography, lithology; geotechnical parameters: rock mass rating, rock quality designation, permeability, plasticity index and allowable bearingcapacity; seismic hazard assessment and climatology to design a tailings storage facility. From the results taken, the type of embankment to be used in tailings disposal can now be identified.

AN AUTOMATED CORN VARIETY SELECTOR,"The system which entitled ""An Automated Corn Variety Selector"" is completed and implemented using PHPS, HTML. 5, CSS 3 and web programming to facilitate the creation Graphical User Interface (GUI). The study is a rule-based expert system. The researchers have chosen PROLOG to implement the rule-based mode of knowledge representation. SWI-PROLOG was used as the inference engine. It was observed that the designed system functioned with a very high effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy as evidenced by the very high usability result when actual software testing was conducted. This study aims to develop an Expert System that would help corn farmers or becoders to select the suitable cor variety. The application of Information Technology had been a great help in automating the knowledge of the experts. Data of the selected con varieties, with its corresponding parameters such as altitude (elevation), season, climate, soil pH, soil type, pest reaction, and temperature are coded into logic rules and inputted in a logic block that tells the system what to do.

Client cannot easily contact a reliable skilled worker in outsourcing services he/she needed. In Butuan City, finding skilled people needs effort, money, and time.

How could a client know that there is a skilled worker nearer in his/her current location? To address these issues, a Multiplatform Service Outsourcing System with Short Message Service (SMS) Contingency Notification was developed to solve those problems which burdens clients in Butuan City and the rest of Caraga region. This system was developed to run in multiple mobile platforms such as Android with version 6 and higher, and iOS version 10 and higher. An embedded Google Maps Application Program Interface (API) and Geolocation as the answer in locating skilled workers in nearby location, Push Notification for real-time notification forwarding, and tapped iTexMo API as SMS based contingency notification for unavailable Internet connection were featured in the system. The developers conducted usability test to measure the usefulness, accuracy, software environment and satisfaction level of the system with 30 respondents using 4 level Likert Scale. The result of 97.59% on usability test has concluded that the system surpassed the 95% acceptability rate among respondents.

TOWARDS TREE ANNOTATION AND FILTERING FOR SEARCH ALGORITHM,"The traditional way of searching items unordered binary tree is through traversal. The known algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breath-First Search (BFS) will exhaustively visit each node to locate an item. The mechanism has major drawback especially on the case where the items are not in the tree. In this paper, a tree annotation is proposed to describe the presence of an element in the tree. The annotation is stored in a vector array of the left and right descendant a binary tree. The vector array is use to evaluate and filter the possible occurrence of the item and to start tree navigation from the root. This approach reduced the traversal time into substantial steps by searching the appropriate sub-tree where the items are located.

SMART WATER DISPENCER,"This invention relates to water dispensers, explicitly having electronic control circuit to automatically shut-off the power supply to the machine when there is no longer water provided to the dispenser from the water container and turns-on the power supply when water becomes available. A liquid level floating sensor is deployed to detect whether there is still available water fed from the container to the chambers (heating and cooling). The liquid level floating sensor sends the signal to the electronic control circuit and cut-off the power fed to the chambers when water is not available. The same electronic control circuit has a light indicator and sends an audible alarm to users that water is no longer available in the container. The same sensor detects when water is already available, and the control circuit supplies power back to the chambers for heating and cooling. This water dispenser also has a mechanism that controls the faucet. The faucet will activate if the mechanical limit switch will be triggered - which is placed under the dispenser's faucet. When the dispensed water reaches a certain height, the faucet automatically turns off. This will be measured with the help of an ultrasonic Keywords: Automatically, Ultrasonic Sensor, Liquid Level Floating Sensor",smart water dispencerthis invention relates water dispenser explicitly

RENDERING OF VIRTUAL LEARNING OBJECTS TO MULTIPLE DISPLAY USING HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION,"This paper describes a human computer interaction (HCI) system that helps in manipulating objects through different machines using hand gesture recognition, without the aid of a mouse or a keyboard. In recognizing the hand gesture; skin color identification, convex hull, palm center identification, and mean shift tracking algorithm was used to identify the number of fingers present and its location in each frame. The identified gesture will be sent over a client server network to execute the controls to other machines specified objects. The system went through a series of testing and acquired a full recognition rate of 81%, 5% error rate and 14% adjustment rate, where adjustment rate refers to the recognized gesture that required the gesturers hand to move back and forth from the camera.

"A PHILIPPINE PESO COIN DETECTION ( A CLASSIFIER THAT DETECTS AND RECOGNIZES 1, 5, 10 PHILIPPINE COINS)","This paper describes a system on the detection and recognition of selected Philippine Peso Coin for Classification. The Circular Hough Transform (CHT) was used to identify the shape and calculate the diameter of the coin. And Haar-like features was implemented for building a classifier of coins. It applies the Gentle AdaBoost Algorithm (GAB), which helps build a strong classifier. The positive and negative images were collected and was trained. The positive images were those of images with the desired object which the system must detect. And the systems could detect and recognizes the object as were focused in this study.

VIDEO-IMAGE BASED: FACE RECOGNITION FOR AUTOMATED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM IN CARAGA STATE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY,"This paper describes the system on how to detect and recognize the multiple faces of students automatically without human intervention. The detected images would undergo through different techniques for image enhancement such as: cropping and scaling process and contrast equalization to improve the brightness of an image Enhanced image could possibly contained an image noise, applying median filtering was necessary to remove the image noise before being recognized. The information of the recognized face image was automatically saved into the database associated to the date and time arrival as they enter the Library room, once the system cannot recognize the detected face images, the image would also be saved into the database to monitor those unregistered student entered the Library. The recognition rate depends on the clarity of images feed to the system, the recognition rate drops down when the distance of students from the camera was beyond on the limit and the system probably perform inaccurately.

RAINFALL SPATIAL ANALYSIS IN BUTUAN CITY USING GIS,"This paper examines the spatial rainfall characteristics of Butuan City during the whole year of 2014 rainfall data. The monthly precipitation database was comprised of four (4) automated rain-gauge stations. Monthly rainfall concentrations have been studied in the context of their mean values and spatial diversification in order to establish the spatial distribution of rainfall patterns and to detect homogeneous areas with similar rainfall evolution. Geographic Information System (GIS) was an essential tool that helps to demonstrate and understand the hydrological analysis of an area. It also helps to promote precision farming for production increase of agricultural products. This study showed the location of automated rain gauges installed in Butuan City and creating Thiessen polygon for computing the average rainfall over the basin. It used GIS for viewing, editing and analyzing GIS data and StatPlanet attractive interactive visualizations which facilitate the interpretation of information and to promote evidence-based decision making by improving and facilitating the communication and interpretation of information.

AUTOMATIC PLATE NUMBER RECOGNITION,"This paper presents a recognition method in which the vehicle plate image is obtained by the digital cameras and the image is processed to get the number plate information. A rear front image of a vehicle is captured and processed using various methods. The information of the recognized plate number was automatically saved into the database associated to the date and time arrival as it enters the gates of the establishments, once the system cannot recognize the detected plate numbers, the image would also be saved into the database. The recognition rate depends on the clarity of images feed to the system, the recognition rate drops down when the distance of vehicles from the camera was beyond on the limit and the system probably perform inaccurately.

METHODS AND DATA PREPARATION FOR THE CCIS FACULTY FACE DETECTION,"This paper tackled about the different methods in data acquisition. This study would explained the different approach in capturing images and preparing those images to be used as a training data which were beneficial to any study relevant to facial detection. This explained as well the different protocols to efficiently acquired data to be used for the study about facial detection. The purpose of this study was to acquire the CCIS images for the preparation of data. The raw images to be collected from the three faculty respondents was about 50 images per faculty. These images would undergo data preparation to ensure that data were effective enough to be used as a training data to any study about facial detection. Those data would then be resized and adjusted into 250x250 pixel dimension which would be useful to any study about machine learning. Thus, the proposed study was an effective way to start acquiring quality data for a machine learning related researches.

RESOURCE UTILIZATION AND MONITORING USING FACIAL RECOGNITION,"This paper will monitor and identify multiple users in a specific location, and record the utilization of the section in the learning facility without much user intervention. Preprocess all detected faces from input face image before recognizing to look more clear and similar to other faces. Preprocess techniques applied eye detection, geometrical transformation, separate histogram equalization for left and right sides of face image, smoothing and elliptical mask. The recognize face image is associated to the time of arrival and the particular sections they have entered in the resource database. The recognition rate for the enrolled person drops down when the person being recognized slowly walks away from the camera. Thus as the distance from the user to the camera gets further, the system may probably perform inaccurately.

LIBRARY TECHNICAL AND CIRCULATION INFORMATION SYSTEM WITH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE CAPABILITY,"This project was intentionally designed with the aim in view to aid of the school library operations using a Computer-based system. This project was in response to basic problems encountered by the library staff in its Technical and Circulation Section. Problems on storing and retrieving of book information were found to be the basic factors that caused irregular transactions in the technical section. The same with the circulation section, there are also irregularities brought by the manual-based system, particularly in the loaning of books where there was no automatic calculation of fines committed by delinquent borrowers. The project team conducted series of discussions and interviews before arriving to its design and implementation stage. Together with the Chief Librarian, Mrs. Nena Malimas discussed essential matters in regards with this project. She provided also the existing forms and records as it was requested by the team for the full grasp of data needed. The team has led to the design and implementation stage by using their gathered data. The team used Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 for the structure of the system, MySQL ODBC 3.51 for the connection with the database and MYSQL Alpha was used for the storage of the records. A Nokia PC Connectivity SDK was also used for the implementation of SMS. The formation of the computerized library system solved the problems within the library processes mainly the storing and retrieving of book information as it was seen in the results. The system did not only speed up the transactions but it also gave the library a more secured system. Security passwords were done with encryption to avoid illegal entry of unauthorized individuals. Furthermore, this project was powered by the Short Message Capability System giving the students to have the information for the availability of the book even at a distance and hassle free in the side of the library staff. This project also provides print out of catalog cards, new purchased books and report for the number of times the book is being loaned.",library technical circulation information system short message

WEB-BASED GIS: PROFILING OF FAUNA IN CARAGA STATE UNIVERSITY,"This research presented the integration of GIS functionality published on web using open source software to visualize the distribution of Fauna in Caraga State University, Ampayon Butuan City. Using PostGIS as a spatial database, it provided storage of the spatial data of different Fauna in order to locate the specie and to fulfill the requirements of how the researchers are to manage the changing data. In addition, the CSU Map was created using the geo-referencing tool from the Quantum GIS (QGIS) and its map projection was WGS 84/ UTM zone SIN. This research also demonstrated the over-laying process of GIS data where the user could visualize the different species of Fauna using the openlayers from the GeoServer. It included not only the information of the specie but also the number of specie found in that area. PHP with XAMPP server was used to store the data and generate the data to meaningful information like Specie Inventory Reports and Fauna Assessment Keywords: Web-Based GIS, Open source, GeoServer,

WEB-BASED TRACKING SYSTEM FOR CSU STUDENTS' BOARDING HOUSE,"This research presented the integration of OpenLayers mapping functionality published on web using open source software to visualize the location of the boarding students around Caraga State University, Ampayon Butuan City. Using Openlayers, it provides an API for building rich web-based geographic applications similar to Google Maps and Bing Maps. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the system was created and programmed using Drupal CMF (Content Management Framework). Open layers consists sub modules like Layers, Behaviors, Openlayers UI, Openlayers Views which shapes the whole map. XAMPP server was used to store the data and generate it into meaningful information.

A RULE-BASED SYSTEM ON SAFETY AND HEALTH GUIDELINES FOR MINERS,"This research was implemented in a web-based environment which was implemented through the use of Joomla 1.5, an open source content management system. It was composed of a rule-based system and a record system. The rule-based system used a rule-based approach in identifying safety guidelines based on standard rules to be followed. The system provides a way to give consistent guidelines to users. The knowledge used in this rule-based system came from experts knowledgeable in mining safety aspects and from DENR Administrative Order 2000-98 known as Mine Safety and Health Standards. The guidelines will be a basis for the safety officers whenever they are making recommendations in their accident reports. The rule-based system was implemented through the use of Exsys Corvid Software. On the other hand, record system records mining company's accident reports and other important records in the database. From the rule-based system, safety officers will be able to get some safety guidelines and safety recommendations for their accident reports. And these accident reports will be recorded in the record system's database for documentation and for generating monthly accident reports. The record system was implemented through the use Web Page Maker and Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 for its PHP, javascript, and HTML codes. To assess the system's usability, performance, and environment impact to users, software testing was conducted in order to know the perception of the respondents with regards to the system. Slovin's formula was used to determine the number of respondents. The testing showed positive results. The system's usability, performance, and environment were rated with a mean of 2.45 or very satisfactory, 2.32 or satisfactory, and 2.34 or very satisfactory, respectively. The overall perception of the respondents indicates that the system is of good quality.

MOBILE E-VOTING SYSTEM IN UNIVERSITY STUDENT COUNCIL (USC) USING CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTION,"This software project presents the development of a Mobile E- Voting that uses cryptographic hash function. The USC Mobile B-Voting System is an android app that can be used during the University Student Council (USC) election in Caraga State University, Main Campus. For the security measure the study used hashing and encryption. The SHA 256 hashing algorithm is used in this study for hashing the student passwords and key used for the encryption of votes in the (University Student Council) USC Election in Caraga State University Main Campus. The ABS 128 encryption Algorithm in Mysql 5,617 is used in encrypting of all votes.

WEB-BASED FOR REPAM (REAL PROPERTY ASSESSOR AND MAPPING) WITH SMS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IN BUTUAN CITY,"This stady illustrated a technique of integrating Open-source Geographical Information System (GIS) Google Application Programming Interface (API) Technology and SMS Integrated System for real estate property assessment and mapping through an interactive user interface. Geospatial data and significant information (such as land owners, land area, assessed value etc.) were incorporated to create a summarized data of property assessment through Google Fusion Table merging functions. Fusion Table supported GIS by converting shp file (shapefile format) into kml in order to express visualization within web-based and two-dimensional maps. Since the Google FT has the ability to generate heel code to display creative and interactive map, it enabled access of map by embedding this html code into the web page created for this web mapping service. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the web-based system was created and programmed in PHP and Javascript language. SQL query for the Fusion Table was performed through java scripting and Google APL. On the other hand, SMS notification system was attained by the SMSLbX from ActiveX component of Visual Basic 6.0 Framework in order to perform SMS-related functions within Nokia PC Suite environment. Thus, through Google Fusion Table and Nokia PC Suite, this created an interactive web-mapping service and easy notification system for real property owners and assessors.

OFF-LINE HANDWRITING RECOGNITION USING RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK FOR ACADEMIC MONITORING SYSTEM,"This study addresses the general problem for academic monitoring of an academic institution. It introduces a system for off-line handwriting recognition on whiteboard lectures. Lectures written on a whiteboard is a new modality in handwriting recognition research that has received relatively little attention in the past. For the recognition, the researchers use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the recently introduced objective function, known as Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), that directly trains the network to label unsegmented sequence data. For topic modelling, an algorithm called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is applied. Wikipedia Corpus and Syllabus Corpus are trained on the LDA model for syllabus topic validation. The researchers' trained model achieves a word recognition rate of 75.9 %, compared with 74.0 % on the previous study.

ADOPTION FACTORS ON ONLINE MONEY TRANSFER SERVICES IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY: A VIEW ON EXTENDED UNIFIED THEORY ACCEPTANCE AND USED OF TECHNOLOGY (UTAUT),"This study addresses the identification and empirical examination of the main predictors that influence consumers' intention and adoption of online Money Transfer Services (MTS) in the Philippines to understand what drives Filipino consumers in the adoption of online MTS and consequently aid concerned entities to improve productiservice delivery and respond to common financial transaction issues. Moreover, both Quantitative and Qualitative methods were applied with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model integrating the extemal variables: Facilitating Conditions, Habit, Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, and Perceived Risk. The survey results from the 205 survey participants were analyzed and found that 83% of them prefer to adopt the traditional MTS with a mean value of 4.15 over online MTS with only 4.0. Also, adopting the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), results revealed that Performance Expectancy, Hedonic Motivation, and Perceived Value significantly affect users' Behavioral Intention towards online MTS adoption with p-values of 0.293, 0.278, and 0.222, respectively. Facilitating Conditions and Behavioral Intention significantly affect users' adoption of online MTS. Results also indicate that constructs Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Perceived Risk, and Habit do not affect consumers behavior and intention to use MTS. The findings of this study suggest that to improve consumer adoption of online MTS, data privacy and security, and information dissemination for consumer awareness may be strengthened. Finally, this study is another confirmatory artifact on the UTAUT model's applicability to investigate consumers' intention and adoption of MTS Keywords: Online Money Transfer, Technology Adoption,

WEB-BASED GIS: ASSETS/FACILITY MANAGEMENT FOR CARRASCAL NICKEL CORPORATION,"This study aimed to design and develop a web-based GIS that can establish and create a spatial database of the CNC (Carrascal Nickel Corporation) area and provide with detailed information and to visualize the location and programs using open source software and tools. A GIS was a computer-based system for the capture, storage, retrieval, analysis and display of spatially referenced data. With Web based GIS and PostGIS, it will be possible to visualized the location of an area in CNC using open source software. Through web-based GIS it is an application that accessible through a browser. It made possible for the users to access GIS with its basic functionalities like searching locations, getting directions, zooming and panning, and printing maps via web browsers. In other words, web-based GIS can be described as geo-spatial information that could be published, searched, analyzed, displayed and processed over the web. With the coming of web-based GIS, a person who doesn't know anything about geography can use the application through any standard browsers.

AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM ON IDENTIFICATION OF BAMBOO SPECIES IN THE PHILIPPINES,"This study aimed to design and develop an automated system on the identification of Philippine bamboo species. The study was implemented through rule-based technique using e2gRuleEngine Expert. Culm height, culm habit, culm diameter, culm color, culm sheath, state of the internodes, number or arrangement (branch complement), growth habit, leaf type, leaf color, leaf long and leaf wide were the identified variables acquired from the experts. The e2gRuleEngine is a java applet that can load Web pages and can write Web page content. Interaction between e2gRuleEngine knowledge bases and the html defining a Web page permits dynamic generation of HTML output as an expert system consultation. Visual Basic was used in order to add rules and prompts. The rule- based technique on e2gRuleEngine was added as one component to Joomla 1.5, which acted as the front end interface for the user. With this study, numerous clienteles can make use of the system in terms of proper identification of bamboo species which leads to a potential increase of bamboo production and providing fast growing cover for deforested area.

CLASSIFICATION OF CACAO PODS RIPENESS USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK,"This study aimed to improve the accuracy and reduce subjectivit? classification of cacao pods by developing a mobile application using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The application focused on real-time classification of cacao pod ripeness based on internal physiological properties and their correlation with maturity levels. Transfer learning with pre-trained models (VGG16 and SSD MobileNet) was employed to enable efficient classification and object detection. The study, demonstrated the effectiveness of using physiological characteristics, such as pH level and SSC values, as indicators of maturity and quality changes in cacao pods. The SSD MobileNet model achieved high accuracy in object detection, indicating its capability to accurately identify objects. The classification model also performed well in classifying the variety of cacao pods. However, the accuracy of maturity classification showed some variation and requires further improvement, particularly with smaller datasets. The mobile application achieved high accuracy in classifying cacao pod variety (95%), but the accuracy for maturity classification was lower (55%), which was attributed to parameter compression in the model. Nevertheless, the smaller size of the application was advantageous. Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of using CNNs and mobile applications for improving cacao pod classification, with room for further enhancements in maturity classification accuracy.

RULE-BASED STUDENT ADVISORY SYSTEM,"This study aims to design a model and develop a Rule-based Student Advisor System using real data to automate the student advising phase during the enrollment process of Bachelor of Science and Information Technology (BSIT) degree program of Caraga State University (CSU). The most important data gathered by the researchers was the knowledge in student advising which was represented as rules using the first order logic. Such rules were verified through resolution principle before coding in Prolog (Amzi! Prolog Ver. 5.0). The data pertaining to both sets of records of BSIT students and detailed BSIT curriculum of CSU which was updated in 2008 that serve as the facts were taken from Database Server (MySQL 5.0). The successful implementation of the model in Amzi! Prolog 5.0, MySQL 5.0 and Visual Basic 6.0 validated the formulated rules in first order logic.",rulebased student advisory systemthis study aim design model develop rulebased student advisor system

AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF RICE PESTS,"This study aims to design and develop an automated system that can identify the major pests and diseases and recommends management to help raise the production of rice. This study implements rule-based technique using SWI prolog 5.10 in which the knowledge acquired from the experts and other sources like parts of rice plant, name/classification of pest, name of disease of rice, food of pest and manifestations of the disease are the identified variables to be used in building rules for knowledge base. On the other hand, through the use of MySql 5.1.4 database as storage of all the major pests and diseases information and Dynamic Link Library, the rule-based technique on SWI prolog is added as one component to the Visual Basic 6.0 which acts as the front end interface for the user. With this system, numerous clienteles can make use of the system in terms of proper identification of rice pests and diseases which leads to a good rice production including experts, farmers, agriculturists and even agricultural technology students.

ANALYZING OPTIMAL LOCATIONS OF SOLAR FARM IN BUTUAN CITY USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYTEM,"This study applies Geographic Information System to paramount the collection of solar energy and maximize the economy of the farm. To achieve the main objective techniques to locate the optimal locations in siting solar farms in Butuan City that would be able of this study, the researcher considered these factors: solar radiation, slope, hillshade, aspect, landcover, distance to city proper, and distance to substations. Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was used to generate the aspect, hillshade, slope, and solar radiation models. Landsat 8 satellite image was used to generate land cover model. Substations located in the City are the data used to generate the distance to substation model. A polygon shapefile of the city proper of the said study area was used to generate a distance to city proper model. The values of the GIS models are reclassified into 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0 values according to the criteria and constraints of siting the solar farms. In weighing analysis, the weights of solar radiation, slope, hillshade, aspect, landcover, distance to city, and distance to substations are 0.30, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.10, 0.10, and 0.05 respectively. The initial result was filtered and simplified considering the minimum area of 4046.86 m2. The output of this study is a map showing the optimal locations of solar farms in Butuan City and its corresponding statistical analysis.

GIS CHARACTERIZATION OF FECAL CONTAMINATION OF GROUNDWATER AND SAFE WELL DEPTH ADVISORY IN BUTUAN CITY,"This study describes a method of an integrated Open-source Geographical Information System (GIS), Object-Oriented Programming Language and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) approach in characterizing groundwater fecal coliform contamination and determination of safe depth and safe age for prospect well sites through an interactive user interface. GIS geospatial analyses and MLR were employed to determine the models that will describe safe well depth and age of prospect sites considering the percent distributions of built-up and cropland areas within its potential contributing area and of persons using the well. Derived models yielded an R2 of 0.727 for safe depth and 0.801 for safe age. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the system was created and programmed in Visual Basic 2008 Express Edition implemented in .Net Framework 3.5. The GIS layers were displayed through the use of Map Control from Active X component of Map Window. Hence, the developed GUI provided and easy and fast access of the valuable information that can guide users on the depth and longest duration of a prospect well that will be safe from fecal coliform contamination.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH REGIONAL OFFICE XIII KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY JOB-REQUEST MONITORING SYSTEM,"This study describes the use of information system in the field of job-requests by using a developed system that is designed for monitoring the requests of the different sections under the Department of Health Regional Office XIII. Job Request Monitoring System is suitable in various computer and communication systems to guarantee small delays to short jobs without knowing the service requirement of any job. In this study the proponents analyze the efficacy of one such scheme- Round robin (RR) - in discriminating between short and long jobs. The proponents obtain the distribution of the delay for short jobs, the cycle time in the queue for long jobs and the number of messages. For the specific parameters used in our numerical results, the scheme seems to discriminate between long and short jobs.

WEB-BASED GIS ANCESTRAL DOMAIN MANAGEMENT USING PULL TECHNOLOGY,"This study entitled ""Web-based GIS Ancestral Domain Management using Pull Technology"" aims to develop a system that will help the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) to shift their community services from the tedious manual processes to automation to keep updated of the current trends and provide fresh information to their clientele. Both Indigenous People and Employee can view information of every Certifificate of Ancestral Domain Titles (CADT) in Map. The researchers used HTML and Bootsrap for the interface, PHP and JavaScript in executing queries, SWAL for additional design and PosGre for database. The purpose of this study is to help the NCIP both municipal and provincial in regards to their data transfer that makes their processes faster. The system allow the user to input data through mobile application or web application. It will also help the Indigenous People in locating their lands and property online without going to the NCIP office.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIPLE BARCODE RECOGNITION IN AN INVENTORY SYSTEM USING ROBUST ALGORITHM,"This study generally aims to design and develop a system that performs multiple barcode recognition which regards to product inventory with the utilization of Robust algorithm. The used the concept of image processing and barcode localization as a method for developing the certain process of barcode recognition. The researchers had conducted an experiment to determine the capability of the system to recognize multiple barcodes in a single captured image. Providing each distant measurement of the mobile phone camera from the test subjects, the researchers was able to record the maximum barcodes recognized by the system. The researchers also visited convenience and sari- sari stores to conduct a survey regarding the usability of the system in product inventory. The result shows that 84% of the store owners find the system easy to use and reliable. The result from testing indicates that 9-11 inches distant measurement of the mobile phone camera from testing products are more capable of recognizing the most number of barcodes. The researchers recommend on utilizing a different algorithm to further enhance the performance of the process regardless the lighting and distance requirement.

USING GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGIES IN HOUSING SUITABILITY IDENTIFICATION IN BUTUAN CITY,"This study illustrated a way of integrating Open-Source Geographical Information System (GIS) and Leaflet Application Programming Interface (API) Technology for developing an automated stem on Housing Suitability Identification in Butuan City. The nonexistence of a centralized system that generates and analyzed geospatial data in Butuan City leads to a difficult way of identifying housing suitability. The researchers create a web based system which aid in land selection on building a house. Geospatial data and relevant information such as flood prone area, fault line, built-up areas, and proximity distance from road were combined to create a summarized data of suitability map. And by the used of model in ArcMap application the researchers can create and manipulate data sets to include a variety of information to the map The ArcMap made it possible for managing geographic information in a database and used for the analyzation of different factors. The conceptual framework that this study used, helps to do the multi analysis more simplier, particularly in resources allocation and land suitability with the help of GIS-based MCA (Mal-Criteria Analysis) model, and used to generate the final result of the map. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the web-based system was created and programmed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript language Keywords: Geographical Information System, Leaflet Application Programming

THE UTILIZATION OF ARDUINO MICROCONTROLLER FOR EARLY WARNING SYSTEM FOR FLOOD,"This study is about utilizing Arduino Microcontroller and GSM technology's SMS application for early warning system of floods. Based on observations and previous experiences, there is no effective system that provides flood alert to the residents especially in the places near Agusan River. With this study, dilemma due to sudden flooding can be prevented. This study consists of hardware and software implementation. For hardware implementation, the equipments to be used are the water level sensor, Arduino microcontroller, and GSM modem. The Arduino microcontroller will act as the brain and control the interfaces between the GSM modem and sensors as well as controlling every action programmed inside the microcontroller. For the software part Arduino Tool 10023 software was used to program the Arduino board that enables the system to detect water level when triggered and sends SMS warning messages. An SMS Gateway was used to manage the received data from the microcontroller via Globe Tattoo. Hence this study was conducted to develop flood early warning system utilizing Arduino microcontroller that is able to alert concerned parties in case of water level rising Keywords: SMS, SMS Gateway,

TOWARDS BOUNDARY SEPARATION OF MVC PATTERN IN CLIENT-SERVER COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT,"This study presents the boundary separation of Model-View-Controller (MVC) components from server-side into client-side of a web application. MVC pattern is commonly used paradigm for most web applications today, MVC pattern is an architecture that separates the business logic from its presentation layer of the application MVC is divided into three components namely the Modell where business logic takes place, the Controller as a mediator between model and view, and View as the presentation layer of the application MVC provides separation of concerns, easier to test codes, better code organization, scalability and code reuse. MVC also have the capability of having multiple views without changing its model. But most of web frameworks using the MVC pamen are server-side MVC Server-side MVC means that the Model, Controller and View components are found in the server. Event processing and updating happens all at the server, thus making the server handle all the processes and eventually lower its performance. Boundary separation of MVC pattern aims to separate one of MVC components into the client-side. This boundary separation separates the View component of MVC into the client-side of the application Separation takes place by using the client-side scripting language like Javascript and Dynamic Object Model (DOM) tree manipulation method. This study also measures the response time of the system to assess their performance using the modified MVC or MC/V and the MVC implementation using Yi framework",towards boundary separation mvc

EFFICIENT IOT BASED RICE INSECT PEST DETECTOR USING YOLOVE AND RASPBERRY PI,"This study presents the development of an Internet of Things (loT)-based system for classifying rice insect pests using a Raspberry Pi and a Pi cam. The study addresses the need for a monitoring system that can effectively detect and classify pests in rice fields. The Raspberry Pi functions as an IP camera, providing access to the live video feed from an insect trap platform. The video feed is then processed using object and image classification algorithms, specifically the YOLOv5 insect classifier known for its speed and accuracy in real-time applications. The detected insect data will be saved as a JSON format and will update in real-time. The classification results are displayed on a dashboard, which includes graphs showing the number of identified insects and the different species present .. By utilizing the YOLOv5 -insect classifier, the system accurately and quickly detects and classifies pests, providing farmers with valuable information to manage their crops effectively. This technological advancement offers significant opportunities to improve agriculture and address food security challenges. The results revealed that the YOLOvs model proved to be an effective tool for identifying and controlling insect infestations, offering potential benefits for improved rice production and resource savings through automated detection.

DEVELOPMENT OF ANDROID APPLICATION USING SOCKET,"This study presents the development of android client-server application using sockets. Most of the widely used of android client-server application uses an HTTP for communication of the client and the server also known as traditional method. However, using sockets have major advantages which are more flexible and faster with regards to communication processes. Using the traditional method is slower because too many handshakes to be done before the reply received by the client. In sockets usually establishes connection from client to server which provide a two-way communication link suggesting a real-time communication. The study aims to integrate the sockets to an android client-server application to improve the issues of the traditional method Keywords: Traditional, HTTP request, Socket based, Client-Server

CENTRAL STUDENT GOVERNMENT (CSG) ELECTRONIC VOTING SYSTEM OF NORMISIST,This study sought to design a Central Student Government Electronic Voting System of Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology - NORMISIST. The design would address the problem of automating the voting system process of NORMISIST. The researchers came up with the general possible solutions of the problem despite of a number of assumptions that had to be made during the early stage of the project. The researchers interviewed the CSG officers to gather information on the voting system processes. With a diagram tool that has been used by using an entity relationship diagram the system were implemented. The system was successfully implemented in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 for its graphical user interface as its front-end and MYSQL for its Database Management System (DBMS) as its back-end.,central

DR. COMILING'S CLINIC INVENTORY SYSTEM,"This study sought to design a clinic inventory system for Dra. Comiling The design would address the problem of automating the inventory process of the clinic. The researcher came up with the general possible solutions of the problem despite of a number of assumptions that had to be made during the early stage of the project. The researcher interviewed Dra. Comilling to gather information on the clinic's inventory processes. From the gathered information, an abstract model of the system was created using UML (Unified Modeling Language) The abstract model was successfully implemented in Visual Basic 6.0 for the graphical user interface, MySQL Server 5.0 as for the Database Management System and MySQL ODBC Connector 3.51.1. The successful implementation validated the design",dr comilings clinic inventory systemthis study sought design clinic inventory system dra comiling design would address problem automating inventory

VIRTUAL ASSISTANCE FOR CARAGA STATE UNIVERSITY E-LIBRARY USING FACE RECOGNITION,"This study uses the advantage of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in making a virtual assistant. It describes how face recognition lessen human intervention in using computer technology. This study uses Eigeneyes in recognition. The captured image will undergo several procedures on recognition. Procedures include geometric transformations like cropping and scaling, and preprocessing techniques like histogram equalization to improve the brightness of the image and bilateral filtering to reduce noise. The user's access to the system depends on the outcome of the recognition. The recognition rate depends on the illumination of the environment.

MAPPING OF USER'S IDENTITY TO ITS VIRTUAL LEARNING RESOURCES WITH THE USE OF EIGENFACE ALGORITHM,"This study utilizes the user's resources without much intervention inside the smart learning center where the identity of the user will be recognized and mapped unobtrusively to the resources in the learning facility. The detected face image will undergo through different geometric transformation such as cropping and scaling process and preprocessing techniques such as histogram equalization to improve the brightness of the image and bilateral filtering to reduce the noise of the image. The identity of the image will be used to locate the users learning materials in the database. The output of mapping virtual learning resources is affected based on the result of recognition. The recognition rate of the image goes up and down depends on how noisy the image is.

A SYSTEM DESIGN OF COCONUT FRAMER PROFILE REGISTRY AND PROJECT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (CFPR & PD SYSTEM),"This study was conducted to create a System Design of Coconut Farmer Profile Registry and Project Distribution System (CFPR&PD). The system is designed as an automated system that will perform an effective and efficient encoding, report generating and data updating in profile registry and project distribution CFPRAPD system is divided into two processes: the Coconut Former Profile Registry where the inputs of all data of coconut farmers are stored and the Project Distribution where the data of coconut seedlings distribution and salt fertilizer allocations are recorded. The CFPR&PD system provides better data organization, updated and easy to generate reports. Manual systems usually result to a disorganized collection of data which affects the response time in the generation of reports, thus consuming extra time that will eventually lower both the system quality and as well as the employees performance Keywords: Automated Systems Desigs, Registry System, Distribution, Information System",system design coconut framer profile registry project

ENGLISH - BISAYA LANGUAGE TRANSLATION USING PROLOG,"This study was conducted to translate the English grammar to bisaya language in a one- way rule using the SWI - Prolog engine. Different methods were being used for the translation. Using Lexical Functional Grammar method in which the area of transformational grammar focuses on syntax, morphology, phonology, of which have always involved separate level of linguistic representation being mapped onto each other via transformation. All information was being stored in a databases for the translation. Results show English grammar can be translated in bisaya language by following a pattern or a set of rules. In transforming the input to its outputs, several pattern should be adhere. If the inputted data, follows the rule of declarative simple present tense, parsing followed and the LFG concept will be the one to transform the grammar.",english bisaya language translation using

ENCHANCING THE PALAY TEXT CENTER OF PHILRICE AN APPLICATION OF RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK,"This thesis paper focuses on enhancing the Palay Text Center (PTC) system at the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) by leveraging the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The existing PTC system, which serves as a text-based communication platform between farmers and agricultural extension offices, faces limitations in effectively responding to farmers' questions, includes misspelled words and the dependency on human agents for manual responses. The primary objective of this research is to diligently address the identified limitations and shortcomings of the existing PTC system, with a firm focus on enhancing its accuracy and responsiveness. To achieve this, the study initiates by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the current PTC system, aiming to gain valuable insights into its operational constraints and areas that require improvement. In order to effectively tackle the challenge of misspelled words in text messages, the research puts forth a cutting-edge machine learning-based approach that capitalizes on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). By leveraging the power of RNN, this approach aims to empower the PTC system with the ability to accurately handle and interpret misspelled words, thereby enhancing the overall communication and comprehension capabilities of the system. To achieve accurate and timely responses to farmers' inquiries, the research focuses on the development of an automated reply system that effectively harnesses the capabilities of the RNN model. By leveraging the power of RNN, this automated reply system is designed to provide precise and prompt responses, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Palay Text Center system in addressing farmers' queries. The empirical results derived from the evaluation indicate a substantial improvement in the overall performance of the PTC system following the integration of the RNN model. The enhanced system demonstrates an impressive accuracy rate of 90% in providing correct responses within the desired timeframe of 0-3 minutes. These results not only validate the effectiveness of the RNN-based enhancement but also highlight its transformative potential in significantly elevating the quality of service provided by the PTC system to farmers.

DYNAMIC TIME ALLOCATION FOR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER USING IOT AND DEEP LEARNING,"This thesis presents a comprehensive study of Dynamic Time Allocation for Traffic Controller Using loT and Deep Learning. The study aims to develop a model that can detect local transportation vehicles in Butuan City using transfer learning method. In addition, the authors also aimed to gather local custom data for training the models: YOLOv3, YOLOv4 and YOLOv5s, evaluate the efficacy of the trained transfer learned models using local custom datasets and compare the models in terms of time complexity when deployed in loT device specifically Jetson Nano. A mixed methods approach was employed to achieve the goal, this involved qualitative and quantitative research methods. The findings of the study reveal that object detection model YOLOvSs stands out when compared to YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 obtaining the highest mAP of 85.8%, with a precision of 100%, a recall of 94%, F1 Score of 81% and a runtime of 24 hours. YOLOvss also performs well in detecting and classifying objects correctly compared to YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 but it has the longest training time. The loT device, Jetson Nano shut down when the 3 models were deployed, but since YOLOvSs performs a highest mAP, the researchers decided to choose YOLOvss to be deployed in the device and change the classification timing from 60-seconds into 1-second to solve the problem of system's overheating. Findings also indicate that YOLOvSs can be deployed in loT devices specifically Jetson Nano. The implications of these findings for identifying the most effective model out of the 3 being compared, performance of each pretrained model when tested using local custom datasets, testing occluded datasets using the transfer learned models, deployment of the model in loT device are discussed, and recommendations for future research are offered. This thesis contributes to the existing body of knowledge in machine learning by contribution to the field of computer vision with artificial intelligence and convolutional neural network. The study highlights the importance of determining the best model for the implementation of dynamic time allocation for traffic controller using loT, and provides valuable insights into deep learning. Overall, this thesis provides a thorough examination of Dynamic Time Allocation for Traffic Controller Using loT and Deep Learning, and offers practical recommendations for the implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems. The study contributes to a better understanding of Dynamic Time Allocation for Traffic Controller Using loT and Deep Learning, and offers a foundation for future research in this area.

EQUIPMENT INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,"Through the advancement of new technology today, there are many ways to have an efficient and accurate solution to a certain problem. One of this is the web-based system application in different transactions and the computer has opened up a new era in manufacturing through the techniques of automation and they have enhanced modern communication system. The researcher conducted a study of the Supply Office of NORMISIST specifically in equipment inventory. This project was conducted in the month of July 2004 and ended in the month of December 2004 Series of interviews were conducted to obtain the complete data of the existing process It was found out that the Supply Office of Northern Mindanao State Institute of Science and Technology is responsible for the distribution of equipment which is a request by the requisitioner and inventorying equipment (check if it is appropriate). In distribution of equipment Memorandum Receipt is used. Mr. Joaquin R. Conde Jr. and the Institute Auditor do the physical count twice a year by using the Equipment Inventory Report. They also separate the waste equipment through the use of Waste Materials Report. The current system is purely manual process. They use different forms in processing data. A thorough study of the current system of Inventorying Equipment and determining its drawback, the current system of the Supply Office will be superceded with a web-based system application in inventorying equipment. They used a software application in making Inventory Report, Waste Material Report and Memorandum Receipt. With this proposed system, the Supply Officer will automatically input the data to the software application instead of manual process. It can minimize time and avoid errors in inputting the data. Then the data is safer because it stored in a database.",equipment inventory management systemthrough advancement new technology today many way efficient accurate solution certain problem one webbased

BARANGAY ACCOUNTING SYSTEM FOR BARANGAY DUMALAGAN,"Today's competitive environment is forcing Barangay to optimize the transaction processes and accounting levels while at the same time ensure accuncy of controls and implementation of standard procedures for the flow of accountant's rules However, in the absence of appropriate systems and information infrastructure, Barangay are finding it difficult to achieve definite and efficient improvement Manual accounting systems utilize several paper lodgers to record financial transactions. Barangay's have separate ledgers for each part of the accounting system, such as accounts payable, accounts receivable and reports. Accountants then consolidate these ledgers into one general ledger, providing the balance for each ledger. The general ledger notebook assists in creating financial statement. Thus, the researchers proposed Barangay accounting system that will give safer storage of financial records, fast retrieval of files, maintains reliability and accuracy, and faster tracking of files. Proposing software for the accounting system is very useful to the staff, from hand written records and manual issuing of barangay clearance and certificates, as well as the income and expenses reports into an automated processing system",barangay accounting system barangay dumalagantodays competitive environment forcing barangay optimize transaction process accounting level time ensure

TRAFFIC STATE ESTIMATION USING FASTER R-CNN WITH INCEPTION V2,"Traffic is one of the biggest problems here in Butuan City especially when it is rush hour and it causes some stress, delay, traffic jams, and traffic congestion because of the huge amount of vehicles running on the road every day. This study addresses the general problem on this study is how to develop an estimation for a real-time traffic state using only optical cameras as sensor. It also aims to identify the vehicle type on the road. The main objectives of this study is to develop a Traffic State Estimator using Faster R-CNN as an object detection and Inception V2 as a classifier. By using the traffic estimator, it can generate the road traffic heat map and for the traffic controllers in real-time traffic state estimation based on traffic flow models integrates the prediction power of traffic flow models with the benefit of real-time traffic measurements. This study represents the traffic flow variables model with the measurements from traffic sensors in the estimation on the process so that the final traffic state estimate is statistically more reliable than the prediction alone. And it gives precise information to create a smarter and safer driving experience, wherever the destination.",traffic state estimation using faster rcnn inception v2traffic one biggest problem butuan

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF WATERSENSE: AN IOT APPLICATION WITH VISUAL ANALYTICS FOR WATER CONSUMPTION MONITORING,"Water is imperative in the regular day to day existence of the human race. Household people use water to sustain life. Nowadays, household people are uninformed of their real-time water consumption. These leads to excessive water usage. With the use of the internet of things (IoT) platform with visual analytics (VA), this study designed and developed WaterSense, a real-time water consumption monitoring for household and commercialized building applications. The study used a ""Hall Effect"" water flow sensor to measure the water flow, which is then processed by a NodeMCU microcontroller. The water flow data is sent to a Heroku cloud database and at the same time shown to the LCD alphanumeric screen attached to every faucet in the building. In visualizing the processed data, this study uses charts for comprehensible reports as visualization. In getting the accurate water flow rate, the calibration factor is set. An accuracy test was conducted in ten trials using ten bottles of 10 liters in one faucet, ten bottles of 10 liters in two and three faucets at a time. The study comes up with a total average accuracy of 99.38%. It is then concluded that WaterSense can make an accurate water consumption monitoring in real- time with multiple faucets simultaneously and the system can identify which faucet has the highest use in a particular time. The developed system can nudge the consumer to be aware of their water consumption.

"WEB BASED GIS: AN IRRIGATION SUPPORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE MUNICIPALITY OF R.T.R, AGUSAN DEL NORTE","Web based GIS is becoming prominent in spatial decision support applications, as it allows researchers and users to benefit from sharing information and visualizing map data sets using open soure software. The study presented the integration of open layers and Geoserver mapping functionalities to the web in order to visualize the location of each barangay with a corresponding different information of irrigation and land suitability including water schedule were incorporated to create a summarized data of land suitability through Geoserver functions. Geoserver supported GIS by converting shape file into kmd in order to express visualization within web-based and two- dimensional maps. It enabled access of map by embedding this html codes into the web page created for this web mapping service. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the system was created and programmed using integrated softwares Javascipt, PHP, Mysql Xampp and Geoserver server was used to store and manipulate the data and generates its functions.
